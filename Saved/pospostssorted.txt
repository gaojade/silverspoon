If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
fyi there is no such thing as “getting back on track” after the holidays because you were never “off track” you were simply living life because you are a human being and you deserve that 
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
You deserve love. You deserve good energy. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you. You deserve to love who you are. You deserve to be at peace. 
Losing weight will not increase my value. Gaining weight will not decrease my value. I am allowed to take up space.  
Reminder: You survived even when it felt impossible to do so 
your body cannot be wrong because there is no right way to have a body 
daily reminder: your weight does not dictate your worth 
Your eating disorder will never willingly let you go. It’s never going to say to you one day, “Okay that was fun while it lasted. I’m done here!!” It just wont. You are its oxygen, the fuel to its fire, its home. It feeds off of your self-destruction, your vulnerability, your logical self. You could be seconds from dropping dead and it will still tell you, you are not sick enough. It’s not a diet, a fad, or a trial period. It’s a life-threatening mental illness with one intention: to kill you. Believe me, you are sick enough. But you are also strong enough to beat it. 
Who am I to wage a war on a body whose only goal is to keep me alive & healthy?? 
If you’re reading this, this is a gentle reminder that you are enough – as is, right now.  
Healing is everyday work. Do not expect yourself to be okay overnight. Let yourself heal gradually and over time. 
Your body burns 15-20% more calories just by existing and you need to eat more to sustain your energy!  Don’t feel bad that you’re eating so much, either – your body needs it! 
you know what doesn’t matter? what other people are eating. seriously. stop. just because your friend karen got a salad does not mean you shouldn’t have the pizza. order that fucking pizza and do not for a second think you’re worth any less than her 
We’ve all heard opinions others have of us. You’re weird. You’re shy. You’re ugly. You’re poor. Who knows what you’ve heard people say about you. But you are not who they think you are. You know yourself better than anyone. You get to determine who you are. Not someone else. No matter what you hear someone else saying about you, you get to determine the truth behind it. 💜
When you start feeling insecure remember: we were all born with confidence, and we can all get it back if we learn to silence the - negative - thoughts that threaten it. Above all, remember you are capable and worthy, regardless of what mistakes you’ve made, regardless of what you’ve achieved! 
quick list of body feel good things:i pinky promise you are not going to wake up looking different after one day (even one week) of “bad” eatingbut also NOBODY is going to have a flat tummy at the end of the day, i mean itset point theory says your body has a range it knows it needs to be in to be healthy & safe & normal and it’s going to fight to stay in that range because it wants to protect you. it just wants to protect you!!the thicker your thighs are the more kittens can lay on your lapyou eat more/have more cravings on your period because your body is burning calories! it’s working harder and needs more energy!clinically obese is one thing but “fat” ?? is not a bad word?? who tf decided it was?? in fact, beauty standards for victorian women involved being rounder. there’s literally no wrong way to have a bodyyour body tells you when it’s hungry— listen. it knows what you need and what’s best for younever underestimate the power of taking a shower or taking a walkyou are alive today bc your body is fighting for you. it’s protecting you from disease & harm & other dangers. it carries u around and keeps u safe. be kind. 
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
I think a weird part of eating disorders is that when you look at people who weigh more, have rolls, fat, cellulite, you don’t see them as ugly. I didn’t look at people and think “God they should eat less.” Because they were and still are beautiful. In fact there were many actors and friends who I thought were stunning regardless of their weight, it wasn’t a factor because they’re just pretty. But when I looked at myself, all i saw was ugly, fat, bad, distorted. So how can we do that? Look at all of our friends, and still think they’re perfect, and look in the mirror and say we’re not? “Because I’m not” you tell me. But you’re wrong. I look at you and I see beauty, I see how unique you are and how no one else can compare because you’re you. Your eating disorder is lying to you, don’t let it steal your happiness, ask for help. 
Fun fact: restricting does not solve your problems 
YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORKOUT TO EAT
you deserve to nourish your body today and every day 
I am becoming the person I want to be. Fuck you if you don’t like her. I like her. She’s doing her fucking best and her fucking best FUCKING ROCKS.  
you do not have to hurt more for your pain to be valid.  
Shoutout to trans people who are trying to overcome eating disorders that are intertwined with their physical dysphoria!It can be hard to separate the two when you’re trans in a world that genders your body shape and fat distribution, but it’s important to keep on fighting the unhealthy urges even when you can’t love your body for what it is. 
The hardest thing to hear when you’re weight restored from an eating disorder is, “oh, so you’re cured now?”It always fills us with an odd feeling. The feeling that our emotions and thoughts are no longer valid as we are no longer underweight. But, I just wanted to remind you that:You can still have an eating disorder if you’re at a healthy weight or if you are overweight.Your thoughts are valid.It is okay to express how you are feeling.You are such a wonderful person, who has fought so damn hard to get to where you are now, don’t let any comments take that away from you. 
•These problems do not define you. 
•Relapses don’t undo your progress! 
•You’re more resilient than you know. 
•You’re worth it, so never stop fighting!
•Recovery is full of ups & downs; it’s never linear. 
•Give yourself a break– you need time to heal. 
•Your body is perfect. 
•Every body is perfect, flaws and all. 
•You’re worth more than your physical appearance. 
•People love you for who you are. 
since it’s national eating disorder awareness week, here’s a picture of me that’s pretty recent. i may not be super toned or have abs anymore like i did at this time last year, but i’m also not eating less than 1200 calories a day and overexercising like i was last year. this is me. this is my body. it’s healthy. last year when i looked “fit”, i wasn’t. my body was so malnourished that after i got home from college i didn’t even have the energy to get out of bed anymore, let alone work out. i was 110 lbs and still thought i was fat. i wasn’t even able to get my period for several months because i wasn’t feeding and treating my body properly. so this is me, healthy. how much do i weigh? i have no idea, and i don’t care. i’m happy with my body and my stomach (which was the place i used to hate the most on my body) but my stomach is cute and it’s rolls when i sit down are cute and i don’t care if i don’t fit into society’s rules of “skinny” or whatever. i’m healthy, and that’s good enough for me 
friendly reminder that you’re never going to look back on your life when you’re 80 years old and wish you had spent more time counting calories and less time living  
EAT WHAT YOU WANT, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT, KISS WHO YOU WANT 
Becoming less of yourself will not heal the parts of you that hurt 
That food is simply a conglomeration of energy and nutrients that help power your cells which keep you breathing and thinking and movingThat calories have no moral valueThat weight is an arbitrary measure of your relationship to Earth’s gravitational pull and in the scope of the universe the difference between Earth’s gravitational pull on any given human compared to any other human is infinitesimally insignificantThat the mirror will lie to youThat you are not a bad person for taking care of yourself or nourishing yourself or addressing your needs or taking up space 
that health is a state of being, not a body type 
Food is not something you have to earn, it’s a need you have to fulfill no matter what you did or didn’t do. 
if you’re trans and you have a restrictive ed please remember that your body does not have to be small to pass. you’re perfect the way you are and you losing weight will not cure your dysphoria. you’re just gonna end up dysphoric and ill. the control an eating disorder pretends to give you is fake and please don’t let it take until you’re in the hospital because you blacked out going up some stairs to realize that. 
The hardest part about trying to recover FULLY from an eating disorder and STAY recovered this time is that it’s a permanent, daily process. I have to actively decide and choose recovery every moment of every day. It’s not something on a list I can just accomplish, check off, and move on to the next thing. It’s a permanent item on my daily list. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around and accept that. 
Sure, loving the way your body looks is a great goal but there’s also something to be said for the slow discovery that it just doesn’t matter to you as much as so many other things anymore. 
Your eating disorder is a terrible translator. ‘I’m a size 10′ is translated into ‘I’m worth less than those who are a size 8 or 6 and should be a size smaller’; this is wrong. What it really mean is ‘I’m a size 10.’‘I ate pizza’ quickly becomes ‘I’ve eaten 735 calories of carbs and fats and I need to exercise and purge and fast tomorrow’; once again, ‘I ate pizza’ simply means ‘I ate pizza’. ‘I gained weight’ seems to mean ‘I am lazy and should be ashamed of myself, I am fat and a fake’; the reality is, it just means ‘I gained weight’.‘My BMI is healthy’ turns into ‘I don’t have an eating disorder and need to lose weight to prove I’m sick’; as you can guess, this phrase still only means ‘My BMI is healthy’.Don’t listen to these shitty translations because they are wrong. The phrases don’t need to be translated, they are factual and mean nothing more than they appear to. 
seriously, i don’t think people with eating disorders get enough recognition for getting through the day. all day their eating disorder voice in their head is screaming “YOUR FAT” “DON’T EAT DINNER” “DON’T YOU WANT A FLAT STOMACH?!!” “STOP EATING” “YOU’LL NEVER LOOK LIKE THEM” “YOUR UGLY” “THEY DON’T LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE FAT” and then there’s the panic attacks, the constant debating of what to eat, when to eat, whether to eat, there’s the sitting next to the toilet bowl and deciding whether to throw up your food, or stick at recovery and keep it down, then there’s avoiding the kitchen so you don’t binge, or getting changed where there are no mirrors so you don’t have to look, there’s the debating whether to step on the scales, and when you do you end up crying, and checking it again and again, as if it would change. and yet, you get up everyday and try and tell yourself that today will be different, you try and soothe yourself, and tell yourself that you are beautiful, and you put your nicest outfit on, you eat your breakfast, and you eat your dinner, and you try your hardest to keep it down, you try and ignore the voice, and go against it, you keep fighting. and, you just don’t get enough recognition. you are strong, you are beautiful, you are BRAVE, my god you are so brave. you aren’t a failure, you aren’t no good, you aren’t crazy. i wish i could hug you all and let you know what a great job you are doing, you are surviving, you have made it through everyday, and you’ll make it through many many more. you can do this, i believe in you. i’m proud of you. 
Fuck diet culture 
One day you’re going to fight off the urge to relapse and it will be the last time you ever have to again, because you will be recovered.And I think that’s worth fighting for. 
YOU DON’T NEED AN EXCUSE TO EAT 
Note to self (and anybody else who needs this)You want to please people and stop their worrying about you? Then eat.You want good relationships? Then eat.You want to be able to laugh and celebrate and drink with your friends? Then eat.You want to do well in your education? Then eat.You want to maintain your employment? Then eat.You want to go on that dream holiday? Then eat.You want to be warm when everyone else is? Then eat.You want to get your period back so you can have kids one day? Then eat.You want to build bone density so that you’re not a fragile old woman by the time you’re 25? Then eat.You want your lips and the skin on your hands to stop cracking? Then eat.You want to experience new things, possibilities, and tastes? Then eat. You want to fucking live?Then EAT. 
We hold onto what hurts because we have become comfortable with it. Let the pain go. Let yourself become comfortable with what feels good. 
One day you will look back and think about all the beautiful memories and moments in your life.Not about how your body looked. 
Though #gainingweightiscool we have to remember that #edrecovery is not about getting dat ass and going from skinny minnie to fit babe (or hunk).For some, recovery means going from a body type deemed socially acceptable and desired, to one deemed less “wanted” and less represented in media, simply because their bodies were never meant to be a size small.By maintaining a body weight under their set point weight range they would have had to hold onto eating disordered behaviours such as restriction, excessive and rigid exercise and food rules that causes mental and/or physical harm. And let’s not forget many people with eating disorders aren’t, never were and never will be skinny. That does not make their condition less valid nor their recovery less impressive.The people I find the most inspiring are those who haven’t gone from one obsession to another, e.g. doesn’t follow a rigid diet where their entire cupboard is from Whole Foods and Iherb, and doesn’t go to the gym rather than seeing friends. I get inspired by free people. Brave people who embrace themselves and start a life that is not 90% centred around food and body.Listen to me;You have not done recovery “wrong” if you don’t have a perky bum and feminine curves, or for males - a toned body with muscles. Recovery is not about getting hot or #strongnotskinny, it is about freedom. - @amalielee​  
GUESS WHO’S BACK! This past year for me has been all about recovery and growing mentally & emotionally strong- and I’m at a point now where I’m proud of the progress I’ve made! I wanted to make a little graphic about the 5 things I’ve been practicing that have undoubtedly brought more fulfillment, love and brightness to my life ♡
People get so mad when I say that I believe all dieting is wrong and unhealthy??? There is no healthy aspect of pressuring people into believing that losing weight will improve their lives and encouraging them work toward a lower weight goal. Getting healthy is something I stand behind 100% but that means eating more leafy greens, learning how to love and care for your body, making sure you’re not taking in too many processed “food” products, doing cardio exercise, etc. For a lot of people that will result in weight loss, but that should not be portrayed as the goal. Focusing on aesthetic beauty rather than inner health is wrong and harmful to everyone involved. This should not be controversial. 
please learn the power of saying no. please learn the power of defending yourself without an explanation. it won’t feel good at first. there will be guilt and shame and questioning; but i promise you, you are worth it. say no. fight for yourself. listen to what your soul needs. be your own advocate. nobody else has the right to take that away from you.  
Never ever feel unworthy of recovery because your symptoms change all the time or are less frequent. You ARE sick enough and you DO deserve recovery. OSFED (other specified feeding or eating disorder) is the most common eating disorder and is the most dangerous because it can goes years untreated. Do not let ED tell you that you are ‘less sick’ because it is all lies to stop you from getting help. 
Reminder: being thin isn’t my life’s work. I am so much more than that. 
FUCK DIET CULTURE, LOVE YOUR DAMN BODY.LOVE YOURSELF.YOU DESERVE SELF-ACCEPTANCE! 
reminder: you do not have to get worse before you can get better. your recovery lies solely in your hands.  
self confidence was THROUGH THE ROOF TODAY 
food isn’t something you have to earn.eating isn’t something you have to deserve.food is fuel and energy and survival.be nice to yourself.give yourself permission to eat.it’ll be okay. 💜 
something that’s stuck with meseeing people recovered on instagram. and not ‘recovered’, but actually embracing how they look and eating freely — cake, pizza, ice cream, yet also salads, fruits, veggies.they’re proof that recovery is REAL and that it’s WORTH IT.if recovery wasn’t worth it like your eating disorder tells you, then why have these people stayed recovered when they could have gone back? why would they not return to their eating disorder if it was as shit as our ed’s tell us?because it isn’t. it’s worth it, and these people are proof. proof that you can succeed without it, proof that you can be happy without it, proof that you DON’T NEED IT. 
it’s raining outside and i can’t stop thinking about how much of my life i’ve devoted to making myself unhappy. how many times i’ve said no to things that might make me smile. how many times i’ve looked in a mirror and pinched my skin, begging it to become empty space. how many nights i’ve torn myself apart for not being enough, for being too much, for being. how many years i’ve shattered my own heart because it felt like what i deserved. i was wrong. i have had terrible things done to me, but i don’t have to be like the people who did them. i’m allowed to be happy. i’m allowed to take care of myself.i was wrong. i deserve to be okay. and please, pause for a moment and think - there’s a chance you might be wrong too.  
their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  
FATS ARE FRIENDS! 
stop listening to serving sizes and start listening to your body  
Don’t wear tight/too small clothes - I know you want to cling to your tiny jeans but, as someone told me in inpatient ‘they fit your eating disorder really well’ - bin them, take them to charity, sell them, trust me it will feel better
Eat what YOU want - not what the eating disorder wants. Sure, some people in recovery post beautiful salads and smoothies and if you feel like that sometimes then enjoy it but if you want chocolate or McDonalds or a dounut, why not? It doesn’t invalidate your illness or recovery or make you a bad person, it just means you are listening to yourself instead of the ED
Base your recovery/plans on YOU, not other recovery blogs - I’ve never made myself a calorie goal or meal plan in recovery, I’ve just based it on how I feel whilst being realistic about knowing how much I need to eat and when I’m hungy or full. If a meal plan works for you or your team have set it then that’s great, if not, that’s cool too
Don’t weigh yourself. Seriously. For the love of happiness and nature and all things good, throw those damn scales away. It brings me to tears to think of the number of girls (and boys) defining their worth as people by that stupid F-ing number
Ask for all the help you need - it looks different for everyone, it could be going to your GP, private therapy, school counsellor, a helpline, or just friends and family. I’ve always found it easier feeling like those aroung you are fighting the illness too
Make sure you’re not trading one behaviour for another. Its amazing if you haven’t binged/purged/over-exercised/taken diet pills for however long but if you have replaced that with another behaviour or diet, becoming veggie or vegan, ask yourself is that healthy for you at the point in recovery you are in or is it fuelling your eating disorder?
Be immensely totally proud of yourself every single day and moment you choose recovery.
 Very often, when people with eating disorders fear recovery, it is not really about the fear of weight gain, or the fear of foods. They might make it to be about that, both to others and to themselves, but truth is, it is often not that simple.It is a fear of losing your identity. You might feel as though you’ve become your struggle, and if your eating disorder left you thin, you might feel being “the thin one” is your identity or purpose.It is a fear of the expectations from others, and society, that comes when you are no longer ill (or “visibly ill”). Now you have to face the world, and you can no longer blame your illness.It is a fear of losing your coping mechanisms. An eating disorder is often a tool to deal with whatever curveball life has thrown at you.It is a fear of letting go of the stability and safety of eating disorder. All these rules and restriction might have given you a sense of predictability. Recovery is messy and unpredictable.But truth is, if something is trying to kill you it is not safe. If something leaves you miserable in the long run, it is not a healthy way to cope. If something leaves you isolated and unable to live a normal, rewarding life, it is not sustainable. Our worst enemies are the ones disguised as helpful friends. Please do not let the lies of an eating disorder seduce you to death. 
you have come so much farther that you ever thought you would, conquered every demon you thought you never could. even if you feel at the lowest of your lows, give yourself credit for the tremendous progress you’ve made. you are capable, you are strong, and you’re going to be alright.  
You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 
I never do this sort of thing but it’s eating disorder awareness week and I’m posting a before and after photo to show all my progress in recovery!  You can really see the light in my eyes!  So happy!        
My body is not your business.My body is not yours to comment on.My body is not here for your approval.My body is not your body. 
I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me. 
I’m done denying myself life and happiness because of trying to be something I’m not. I’m a broad-shouldered, big hands and feet northern woman with a big bone-frame, and I’m finally proud to say that… that it’s okey. I’m not and never will be super tiny and light because I wasn’t built that way. I’ve finally come to accept that. 
Look at my plump cheeks, chest and arms in the second close up. I look happy! And I AM! I can actually eat delicious food again (I love bread), and have energy for drawing and studying and hiking and playing the piano and ALL the things I like, because I did.not.give.up. I faced my fears HEAD ON and now I’ve figured out that I’m freaking invincible, because I could the ONE THING I was most afraid of in the e tire world. 
So my message to you all is this: I want you to take a good, hard look in the mirror and reconsider not taking that piece of cake and or that extra serving of dinner. You can’t fix your problems this way. You can’t just focus on starving yourself or working out 24/7 because it’s madness and wasting away your life. You can’t starve away how your bones where built. Let your body be what it’s supposed to be, and try accepting it for it’s flaws
I’m still struggling with it, but I am never gonna give up trying, every single day. This is anti “thinspo”. I want none of you to go through the hell I’ve been through., waste a decade of your life over shit like this. It doesn’t just go away over night, if you get an ed you will suffer the consequences of that illness for life. I still have no idea how to eat correctly, how much or even what to eat. Please don’t destroy yourself. Be good to your body because it’s the only one you’ve got, and it needs you so desperately to keep it healthy and good. You are so worth it. If I can do this, so can you! Now go fight, be brave and let yourself LIVE!  
Ain’t nothing wrong with touching thighs, just look how happy that kitty is to be there!!!Originally posted by cutekittensarefun 
Eating disorders are stupid because they make you forget how fucking good a fresh baked brownie is and that’s that.  
You have permission to recover You don’t have to be at death’s door to recover. You don’t have to have a dangerously low BMI to recover. You don’t even have to be underweight to recover. You don’t have to be formally diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia, or another eating disorder to recover. You don’t have to be skin and bones. Your hair doesn’t have to be falling out. Your body does not have to be shutting down in order to recover. There is no such thing as “not sick enough”. If you’re looking for a sign that it’s time to seek recovery, to start on the journey to seeking and getting help, this is it. You can get help. You can recover. You have permission.  
ED Recovery blogs::Please like or reblog this if you are a personal ED recovery blog.I feel like the ed recovery community has almost disappeared from tumblr over the past few years and has mainly moved to instagram, which is sad. Like//Reblog this if you are working in recovery and hopefully we can help support each other/celebrate victories together. Recovery does not have to be a road you walk alone x 
Eating is a necessity, not a privilege. Love and care for yourself. @madsrecovers 
Sometimes you’ll eat too many cookies when you’re enjoying life. You’ll eat salads when you need more vitamin K, or some extra dinner when you’re still hungry after a first helping. Maybe you’ll go for a run because you like to, or you’ll swim laps in the pool because it’s hot out. You won’t count how many calories you’re burning because you’re living. You care about your livelihood and health. You will be living and you’ll be happy – this is recovery. And it is wonderful. 
Wanting and willing are two very different experiences.You can want good grades, but that means nothing without being willing to study.Similarly, you can want to recover from your eating disorder, but without being willing to change behaviours, gain weight, challenge rules etc etc, you are not going to get very far.On the other hand, you don’t have to want recovery (at least initially) in order to be willing to change. You can be willing to give gaining weight a go without wanting it. I can assure you that the majority of recovered people out there would agree that they didn’t necessarily want to make the painful changes that recovery demanded. But they were willing to try.Be willing to try something new. Be willing to have an extra bite of dinner, to sit down instead of run, to nourish rather than punish. It is far too easy to become trapped in a state of wanting and wishing change without taking any actions. It is not enough. Don’t let your illness trick you into thinking it is. 
I am tired of being hungry, I am tired of excuses not to go out, I am tired of searching up numbers on plastic bags, I am tired of the taste of water, coffee and green tea, I am tired of letting myself down, I am tired of punishing myself every time I eat, I am tired of punching myself on the stomach every time I feel full, I am tired of smelling like vomit because of what I did on the bathroom, I am tired of looking at skeleton girls wishing I was them.There are so many reasons why I want to recover…. I felt trapped here on this blog because I have 6k people following me here and I know this number will go down with this decision but I don’t care (actually I do because this means that you don’t want to recover and I want you to recover but oh well….). You are all so important to me and I know how hard this living hell is, this is why im fighting against it. And you can do this too because if I can do this you can!! I believe in everyone here and I believe WE can be happy without ana. Right now she is screaming in my head saying that I can do this to her, that I have to be thin and pretty and look like a sick person so people can worry about me but I am telling her to fuck off. Guys you can always message me and I will always be here for y'all! Send me a question or ask for any tips on recovery! I will also post here what I do to motivate myself when Im down or pics of my recovery journal (and poetry as always)! Loads of love and kisses for u!! Stay safe (FOR REAL) and go eat that piece of cake you wanted so bad) :))) 
four years in recovery today.
messy hair, sleepy eyes, crazy day, full heart. 
that’s what happens when your life becomes much bigger than your eating disorder. 
If you never eat, you will still feel fearIf you only eat half of what you need, you will still feel fearIf you fully nourish your body, you will still feel fear.Your eating disorder is lying to you. You will not become untouchable of you give in. So embrace the fear, the pain, and the discomfort. But embrace it from a healthy, unrestricted perspective. Like physical wounds, you will heal much better if you are taking care of yourself. 
please remember that just because someone’s recovery looks a certain way does not mean that yours needs to look that way too. recovery is about becoming friends with your body again - YOUR body. so listen to it. honor it. trust it.  
Either way, you’re a warrior. Don’t forget it. 💜 
friendly reminder:💫 you are a wonderful person💫 your mental illness is a piece of crap💫 you deserve recovery💫 you deserve happiness💫 you can do this, stay strong!💫 there is always someone who cares about you💫 you are not alone 
Just let it go. Shake it off. Remind yourself this is no longer serving you. It is okay to no longer entertain what is not helping you grow. Whatever it is that’s stopping you from being you, just let it go. 
Messages to those struggling with an Eating Disorder from someone in recovery***disclaimer that I am in no way a professional therapist. I am simply speaking from my own experience with ED recovery and struggling with an eating disorder***-I’m so proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for staying strong. I’m proud of you for being alive. I love you-it doesn’t matter how much weight you have or haven’t lost, if you are hurting your body you are hurting it period. You don’t need to lose a specific amount of weight to have an eating disorder. It is classified as a MENTAL disorder for a reason. You are valid no matter what and just because someone’s disorder may look “worse” than yours doesn’t mean yours isn’t bad. I don’t care what you say, you are VALID.-you deserve recovery no matter what. You hear me? NO MATTER WHAT.-If you say you “haven’t been sick long enough” Nonono you can recover whenever. WHENEVER! Eating disorders aren’t linear. You don’t have to be sick for a certain amount of time to considered “officially sick”. There is no “time spent suffering” requirement. You could be damaging yourself as soon as you start engaging in behaviors. You are valid and you deserve to get help whether it started weeks ago or years ago.-If a doctor says you can’thave an eating disorder because you aren’t underweight go to another doctor. Fuck them. Fuck anyone who says that to you. That’s not true at all. Throughout my whole eating disorder I never once looked sick. I was never once underweight. But I was so sick mentally. Please don’t let anyone tell you those horrible things. It’s just not true and doctors and psychologists have proven that it’s not true. -Your disorder is still valid even if no one sees it. I see it. I hear you. I’ve been there. You are still valid no matter what. You still deserve help. I love you.-No, you aren’t the only one these rules DON’T apply to. Even if you don’t believe it, this applies to you.-No matter what mistakes or failures you have made in your life, you never deserve to hurt yourself. -You will NOT be nothing without your disorder. You have amazing characteristics that are just being masked by the disorder. If you were to recover, you would find new amazing passions and skills you never even knew you had. You will not be nothing without your disorder. You will be everything. -Recovery is so scary and so hard, it means facing your worst fears. Believe me I know. But once you get over that initial hurdle and start healing mentally and physically, it gets easier. I swear 100% it gets easier. Your life gets better. You feel alive again. You feel free. You feel liberated. You feel like you could dance in a field of wildflowers. -For most people, eating disorders develop because you don’t want to face the pain and trauma in your life so you use it as a coping skill to numb yourself. And once you realize that it can make recovery even more scary. Will I be in even more pain? What do I do if it becomes too much to deal with? I promise you that facing your pain is a lot less scary than it seems. Yes it is hard and heartbreaking and terrible. But destroying yourself with a disorder isn’t going to fix it, it isn’t going to make that pain go away. Temporarily yes, but it will always be there until you face it. Your disorder isn’t helping you. It’s going to hurt you even more than you’re already hurting.-Relapses will happen, even if you’ve been in recovery for years. BUT, they do NOT mean your progress has been erased. You have hit a speed bump not a road block. And you will be strong enough to get through it. I believe in you.-When you have an eating disorder you miss out on life. I don’t remember anything good about my life last year. All I can remember is counting calories, crying, and purging. You deserve to enjoy life. You deserve all the good things in life. You don’t deserve to suffer at all. -Your eating disorder will do nothing but hurt you and destroy you, it makes you miserable and sad. Skinny doesn’t equal happy no matter what! I promise you it doesn’t. You wanna know what does make you happy? Eating ice cream with friends. Enjoying the taste of chocolate. Being able to go out to eat and not have to google the menu beforehand. Not having to count calories every single day and night. Not crying over food. Being able to enjoy living and not constantly destroying yourself. No matter who you are, you never deserve an eating disorder. Even if you feel like you do, even if you feel like a failure or disgusting or a loser. You will NEVER EVER deserve that disorder as a punishment. You wanna know what is disgusting? The disorder. You wanna know who’s beautiful and strong and amazing? YOU. Please never ever forget that.  -Recovery is possible and always an option, and you will always always deserve it. 
Note to people struggling with eating disorders:It’s easy to forget that the way that you view the world is different than the way everyone else does. The illness puts a filter over things so that you don’t see reality. The truth is that even though you might see all the little changes in your body and the so-called “imperfections”, the average person doesn’t pay attention to those kinds of things. Theres no way they’ll notice  if you gained ten pounds, let alone whatever changes you feel happened overnight. Due to being sick you have a preoccupation with these things that others don’t have. It’s easy to think that the way you see the world is normal, but in the disorder, it’s far from it. The average person doesn’t think about someone’s weight when they meet them; they see them for all their other traits first. The disorder has trained you to pick any body changes out in order to keep yourself sick. But in reality, these things don’t matter at all.Remember this next time your disorder tries to tell you that everyone will judge your shifting, recovering body- in reality, they’re too wrapped up in their own lives to notice whatsoever. 
maybe things are getting bad again. maybe you’ve been doing so well, you’ve really, genuinely felt yourself getting better - and suddenly you’ve slipped and found yourself stuck in the very same dark hole you fought so hard to climb out of. i know you’re disappointed in yourself. i know you’re angry and frustrated and beating yourself up and losing hope of ever getting better with each passing second. i know. but I want you to know that it’s okay. you’ve been fighting so hard and I’m so proud of you. one slip up doesn’t erase all your progress. recovery is still within your reach. always remember that you’ve fought your way through this before and made it out alive. this time will be no different.  
I will grow from this 
Glorify recoveryGlorify full meals, a good nights rest, and doing your best. Glorify making the consious decision to be better. Glorify the daily struggles to do whats best and ignore the evil whispers your disorder wants you to trust. Glorify winning those little, silent victories. Glorify feeling warm, full, and refreshed. Glorify health and happiness and caution. Recovery can be beautiful if we rest during our bad days and rejoice on our good days. Weather you are moving up or down, you are still moving forward. Glorify recovery, not illness.  
Hey just some lil things for you to remember!You haven’t eaten too much (even if you binged)Any food is good food!You need carbs, fats, fibre and sugars! Have a look up the daily recommended intake of those if you want more info, but don’t obsess over it! It is just a recommended intake amount.Your body looks gorgeous today! Everything about it is stunning ♥Don’t purge please, it’ll make you feel worse and it doesn’t even get rid of calories, don’t hurt yourself over food.Please be wary of pro-ana/mia blogs! They will just make your mindset worse, surround yourself with happy and positive things and people.Keep exercise to a reasonable amount for your intake.You are loved and you are beautiful, I promise!If you need someone to talk to I’m always here ^u^ 
- if a food makes you happy or you crave it a lot, have some! depriving yourself of food is just gonna make you crave it more and when you finally snap you will binge eat 10x more bad things than if you just had this one small thing
- recovery takes time !!! lots of time !! ive had my ed for 5 years and ive fallen in and out of recovery and its hard but it is doable!!! 
- ive lost more weight nourishing my body with healthy things and exercising a few times a week than i ever did starving myself
- self love is not a sudden thing. no one wakes up entirely in love with themselves. it takes time and energy and yes ! its okay not to like certain things about yourself but they make you unique and most of the time they cant be changed and thats okay!!!
- thigh gaps r not for everyone!!! not everyone can achieve a thigh gap! it completely depends on your bone structure, you could be at the lowest weight possible and still not have a thigh gap because of your bone structure but thats okay! thigh gaps do not determine your worth as a human (but if you do have a thigh gap thats fine too! everyones bodies are different)
- eat more fruit and veggies!!! honestly!!! blend them in a smoothie or cook them or eat them with chocolate, who cares!!! they will help ur skin, ur hair and ur mood as well as many other benefits. try and eat at least 2 or 3 portions a day because yes theyre expensive and not everyone can manage 5 a day. 
- u are allowed to treat urself with unhealthy food!!! ur body is smart and can cope with u eating a slice of cake or a bar of chocolate
- u should not fear food!!! food is ur friend!!! especially healthy foods, but also unhealthy foods for when u need them.
- throwing up your food does more damage than it ever will do good. it is so bad for ur emotional and physical well being and is found to make u gain more weight than lose it ! 
- u shouldnt feel the need to lose weight. if u want to do it in a healthy way thats ur choice but people see more in you than just a number or a body i promise
- your ed will not vanish overnight. it takes months, maybe years of recovery to feel fully recovered but you can get better everyday and it will be so worth it when you look back and think about how far u have come !!! ❤️ 
But recovery is. 
Eat to be healthy. Exercise to be strong.Restricting is not healthy. Obsession is not strong. 
Living with a disorder like BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), can be so draining. Everything is black or white, emotions are red hot or ice cold, love is anxiety ridden or bordering on hate. The hardest part? Knowing that we are too intense for most people to handle. 
But you can’t always focus on the bad aspects of things. You have to take the good with the bad. So even though there are intense ups and downs, I always know I’ll get back up again and still love, have hope, and try to keep going. I may break easy and crash hard, but when I’m high and in love, nothing can stop me. 
Keep going and live for the ups, the downs only prove how good the ups are and allow you to enjoy them fully. 
Small reminder that recovery is worth it.
Small reminder that recovery is possible.
Small reminder that YOU are capable.
YOU CAN DO THIS AND YOU WILL. 
Sometimes it may seem as though you do not have a hold on your life anymore or you’re not the one controlling the reins. Sometimes it seems as if somebody else has taken ahold of them and aren’t steering you very wisely.  Sometimes it may even seem as though that happiness is too far gone to get back. Maybe your heart is so big that every little thing has an impact on you and tears you down. Maybe somebody just straight up tore down your walls and you feel as though it would take a nation to build them back up. But you’ve forgotten one major detail and fact. YOU are the only person in charge of your own happiness. You are still here, so it is never too late to have that happy feeling back once again. You are in charge of your own thoughts and of the negativity that you allow into your life. Isn’t it amazing that we have such a power? Take advantage of that power, and be happy once again. Not for everyone around you, but for yourself. Sometimes you do have to be selfish, and it is okay! Because that feeling you’ve been missing is a very important aspect in your precious life. Let’s take control and get it back!  -Ariana 
It’s okay to recover.It’s okay to gain weight.It’s okay; i’m okay.My life is not over because I have gained weight.The people I love are happier now that i’m healthier than they were when I was struggling.I am happier now in recovery.It’s okay to recover. 
But I’ve noticed that I’ve been getting better. My energy is starting to come back. I feel stronger and I’m for confident I can fight what stands in my way.
Don’t give up as hard as it gets, as heavy as it gets. Find somebody who will help you lift the weight and I promise it will all come back to you💜
one of the essential steps in making peace with your body is wearing clothes that are comfortable. bras or underwear that dig in, waistbands that are very constricting, shirts that make you self-conscious so you never bend over… that stuff is right out. if you’ve only ever chosen clothes for how they look or whether they’re “flattering”, or if you’ve recently had a change in your body size/shape, explore what makes you feel comfortable. do a body scan when you’re wearing an outfit and if there’s a bad feeling anywhere, switch that item with something that feels good or neutral. it can take a while to learn how to dress comfortably; it did for me.issues of gender expression or lack of resources to obtain new clothes can definitely complicate this. but in general, be as kind to your body as you can with the clothes it spends day after day in. 
ok ok but ya know what i’m realizing?? HAVING AN EATING DISORDER IS SUCH A WASTE OF MY LIFE. in the time I devote to my ED, how many more people could I help?? how many more laughs could I have? how many more breathless moments could I experience? how many beautiful runs could I go on? how much of the patriarchy could i crush?? I AM JUST DONE. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR. THIS IS NOT WHO I AM. I CANNOT CHANGE THE WORLD WHILE HAVING AN EATING DISORDER 
Today is my birthday and I’ll eat a slice of cake. I won’t purge after. I will eat that damn thing and it won’t make me immediately obese. It won’t. It won’t. I promise myself it won’t. Today anorexia won’t win.  
Fuck anorexia and the idea that I would only be good enough when I was thin 
- Your ED is lying to you- Losing more weight will not make you love yourself more- Losing weight will not make the people around you love you any more than what they already do- Eating normally again will truly make you feel better physically and mentally- Weight loss does not cure a negative body image.  And long as you continue to have a negative view of yourself, you will never like how you look, no matter how much weight you lose. 
Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 
‪You have every right to be yourself. Own it. Love it. Be exactly who you are and don’t ever apologize for it.‬ 
Recovery is gaining fat even though you hate yourself. It’s crying while eating, but forcing yourself to do it so you can survive. It’s eating foods that are scary to you and not limiting yourself in any way!!! It’s not all sun shine and fucking rainbows. 
I’ve been going to therapy for just over a year now, and there is one appointment in particular that was monumentally life-changing. My therapist and I were discussing my self-destructive, self-sabotaging behavior. She asked me, why is it that I continued to choose to act in a way that I know hinders my recovery? And I said that I didn’t know, but that I wanted to get better, and promised that I would actually try this time, that I would begin actively correcting the poisonous, negative self-talk that had become so routine to me. I was lying, and I knew it. She knew it too. So she called me out on my bs - she shook her head, told me she didn’t believe me, and said something that put a lot of things in perspective for me: if you keep holding onto this self-destruction, it means it gives you something that you’re afraid to lose if you get better. I didn’t have an immediate answer to what that “something” was. So I thought for a few minutes. And suddenly it clicked. The thing I was afraid to lose by getting better was the validation my mental illnesses and destructive behaviors gave me. I thought they validated my pain, my bad days, my bad feelings, and if I recovered, it meant that I had no right to feel bad anymore. And the fear of losing that validation caused me to cling onto my mental illnesses to the point where they became my identity. I had no idea who I was outside of my screwed up brain chemistry and the traumatic experiences I’d gone through. And for the first time since I started therapy, I cried in that office. So what I want to tell you is this: your pain is valid regardless if you’re at your lowest point or in recovery. Having good days doesn’t erase the fact that you have a mental illness - if anything, your good days are proof that you’re capable of conquering it. I know it’s not so simple to just go cold turkey on bad habits and immediately embark on your road to recovery. But to anyone struggling with mental illness, I just want you to know that you are so much more than the pain you’ve gone through. And choosing to heal is all the more proof of that.  
There is no magical target weight which you must maintain for the rest of your life. A BMI of 19, 20, whatever, does not mean you are recovered, it just means your weight is only just considered healthy
You are allowed to eat more than your meal plan - don’t view it as strict rules, as long as you are eating ENOUGH, you can always eat more
Eat foods that YOU like - sticking to the same foods everyday or choosing ‘healthy’ options all the time is your ED talking, eat cake, eat mcdonalds, eat a salad then chocolate, enjoy food
Recovery is not measured by weight. I repeat RECOVERY IS NOT MEASURED BY WEIGHT. You could be your highest weight and seriously ill, you could be a low healthy weight and be recovered, being a certain weight does not mean the MENTAL illness is cured
I am super proud of you and you should be too x
You’re working hard, you’re doing well, you deserve to rest. 💜 
You really deserve to 💜 
reblog/like this post pls !! i need more recovery experiences/inspiration/hope/etc in my dashboard ✨
friendly reminder that you made it until this point in your life. you went through so many struggles and you’re still here. i’m so proud of you, keep fighting 🌞💛💫🌻 
Sometimes it is planning relapses late into the night, and then getting up the next morning and making breakfast regardless of how much you want to run in the opposite direction. Sometimes it feels like you are losing all control over your life and that every little change is magnified a thousands times over.But just because you feel this way right now, and may spend hours planning your next relapse, it does not mean that you have ‘failed’ or ‘messed up’. No.Recovery is a journey; it is a learning curve. It is not always going to be a straight road, but that’s okay, no one said that it was going to be ‘easy’.Your feelings and emotions, whatever they may be, are very real and valid.  You are allowed to feel this way. And yes, it is okay to be having ‘second’ thoughts, however don’t lose sight of the reality of the situation; don’t let yourself get caught up in the numbers and the games. This is your life at stake here; and you are currently playing with fire. Giving into those disordered thoughts may ease your anxiety in the short-term, however it won’t last long, and it will always come back for ‘more’. Relapse is not the answer. Although the storms may be raging in this moment, they will not last forever. They will pass by and the waters will settle. You can and you will get through this. Hold on. 
Weight restored 🌜🌛 
Your body is your friend, not your enemy. 
Really hoping I heal from all of this and I live a beautiful life and can be at peace

02/08/17Posting this purely to piss off anorexia. Chubby face. Spot break out. Who cares. Screw you. I want to live not just survive. 
You need to recover regardless.
Wanting to love who I am means I’m going to have to stop all of this. To stop punishing my body, who I am, and how I feel. To let go of this. To not allow it to ruin things for me. I have to give up all of its control over me. I have to live because living is not this 
Trying to love yourself is really hard. Recovering from many years of an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety is hard. Praying that I get there. Praying. Praying. Always. 
I want to recover so that - I won’t think about food all the time and I can focus on uni- I can enjoy food again-I’m happier- It will stop ruining or damaging relationships-I can live my life-I can eat out without so much anxiety and worry-I can spend my time doing stuff I actually like than working out or endlessly calculating -I can be more peaceful and emotionally stable -I can talk to others freely and openly -I can stop hating myself and become more confident 
You are not alone. Maybe there are not as many of you posting about it on social media. There may be fewer blogs and vlogs chronicling the process or inspirational accounts with people your age going through this experience. Maybe there are less of you who recover and then come back to tell your stories. But, even if you don’t show up as much on instagram and tumblr feeds, you do exist.You see, eating disorders don’t magically stop when you reach 30. Many of you have developed ED’s after giving birth. Some go through midlife and the stress of that provokes your genetic predisposition. OR you notice a resurgence of ED thoughts in your 30′s, 40′s, 50′s and beyond when you thought you had recovered as a teenager. It happens. I’ve seen all of the scenarios above and more play out. I’ve also observed that it is extra hard to reach out when you are an adult who is struggling. Suddenly there is rent or a mortgage to worry about. There are children involved. There is a job you don’t want to lose. I get it. So many others get it. You just don’t post about it as much. I used to wonder if it was possible for an adult, who had struggled for years, even decades, to recover. But I’ve seen it happen. I know women in their 50′s who are just experiencing freedom from their ED for the first time in their adult lives. It isn’t easy, but I am telling you that it is possible. I know it is easy to feel alone when you are recovering as an adult so I want to encourage you to find the support you need. ED’s thrive in isolation. Connection is critical. This is me giving you a big virtual hug and hopefully the little nudge you need to reach out. I am holding space for you to do the tough stuff needed in order to get well.Peace & Blessings,Rachel 
Haven’t had actual pancakes in years so ya recovery is pretty dope 🥞 
i’ve always wanted to rock overall shorts, but my body image and lack of self confidence always made me hang them back up on the rack whenever i found a pair i liked.yesterday, i said fuck it. i tried them on and bought those suckers.small wins, folks. small wins. 
There’s a ~40 lb difference between these two photos. Gaining this weight gave my me life back. 
Dear Georgina, You are deeply intelligent, strong as fuck, and within you lives a celestial universe; a divine goddess. You do not have to live in an eating disorder. You don’t have to numb and be smaller and harshly blunt your enthralling, creative, divine femininity. Now you’ve cultivated the tools to fight like hell against your mental illness. Darling, please always take up infinite amounts of space. 
I don’t have to like my body, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like that I have to eat, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like the discomfort that comes with meals, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like the struggle of fighting purge urges, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like recovery, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like myself, but I need to accept myself.–Inspired by wise words from my dietitian  
so! i’m heading into my first summer of recovery, and i’m trying to make the most of it while staying healthy and focused on my future. these are a few of my plans to optimize my summer while keeping it worthwhile, fun, and safefind some habits you want to build. they don’t have to be big things, but it is nice if they’re things that make you happy. personally, i want to start cooking again, be consistent with my journaling, be creative at least once a day, and maybe start exercisingwhat are some things you’ve been meaning to get done? whatever you didn’t have time for during the school year, especially if it would make your life easier in the future. i’m going to be doing a thorough cleaning and organization of my bedroom, remaking my spotify, going through the photos on my computer and deleting the unimportant ones, and retaking my codeacademy courses on html and cssif you’re anything like me, summer is the loneliest time of the year, because you don’t have school bringing you and your friends together every day. instead of isolating yourself and waiting until september to see everybody again, try to plan some time doing activities with other people! volunteer, find an internship, hang out at the cafe on your corner every morning until you start talking to the other regulars. make plans to meet up with old and current friends, relatives, and other people you lovedon’t stress yourself out. sleep in an extra hour, stop scheduling your time down to the minute, take time to relax and be bored and do nothing. don’t spend all of your time being productive. summer isn’t the time to get burned outat the same time, don’t spend too much time doing things that don’t contribute to your short-term joy or your long-term happiness. i try to differentiate between time spent on games, media, and other things that make me happy in the moment, and time spent doing things simply because i’m bored (scrolling through buzzfeed or social media, watching bad tv shows, and playing candy crush). i’m not saying that you should avoid these things entirely, but don’t let them take up too much of your time. you don’t want to spend your last few days of summer wondering what happened to your weeks of free timetry to find yourself again. work on your mental health. go to therapy, or find cbt and dbt worksheets online. build up strength for when you need it most. make an emergency box for mental health crises, find something to fidget with when you’re anxious, learn what works for you and what doesn’thave fun! break the rules sometimes. nothing has to be set in stone. make some memories for the year ahead, but don’t sabotage your future in the process 
On June 1st, I’ll be 6 months clean from bulimia. It really does get easier. Hang in there. 
you are more than enough.  
🌸🧬💘💓Life really is too short to be worrying about how my body looks and what I eat. It’s time to just be happy and free and enjoy this life🌸🧬💘💓

If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
For the past couple of weeks I’ve been stuck in this under eating (not restricting really but not eating enough) and over eating (not binging but eating more than I should). I can’t help but want to lose weight again, and I even have been trying to do so, but then the next day I feel guilty for doing that and eat more. I’ve also been really depressed lately and feeling really unworthy so my ed has been resorting to either restricting or binging as a coping mechanisms.I feel like crap about it, someone got any advice? I know I should stop counting calories but I just can’t help it, it makes me (well my ed rather) feel safe. Ugh, recovery is hard. 
Choose recovery,Choose recovery again,And again,And again, and again, and again, and again.  
things you need calories for: solving equations or writing poems to fight for things you care aboutkeeping yourself warm to sleep well at night and stay awake during the day to be happy  
For all of you out there having recovery as your new years resolutions: I am rooting for you with all my heart and I sincerely hope you achieve your goal. 
Did you know that when you eat enough food every day your mood is improved, your body doesn’t hurt, and you have the energy to accomplish tasks throughout the day? What a wild, novel concept. 
your body cannot be wrong because there is no right way to have a body 
if you’ve had a rough few days lately, please know that there will be a day when you’ll wake up and things will feel easier. you’ll see the good in things, you’ll feel the warmth in your heart again, I promise <3

Just as its never to late to start recovery, it’s never too early either. You don’t have to fall a certain amount before you can pick yourself up. The longer you hold getting help off, the harder it will become later. So take a step today; have a shower, go outside, talk to someone. Whatever it may be for you, do one thing to better yourself. I know your future self will thank you for it. 
If you ate something, I’m proud of you. Unconditionally.  
I think a weird part of eating disorders is that when you look at people who weigh more, have rolls, fat, cellulite, you don’t see them as ugly. I didn’t look at people and think “God they should eat less.” Because they were and still are beautiful. In fact there were many actors and friends who I thought were stunning regardless of their weight, it wasn’t a factor because they’re just pretty. But when I looked at myself, all i saw was ugly, fat, bad, distorted. So how can we do that? Look at all of our friends, and still think they’re perfect, and look in the mirror and say we’re not? “Because I’m not” you tell me. But you’re wrong. I look at you and I see beauty, I see how unique you are and how no one else can compare because you’re you. Your eating disorder is lying to you, don’t let it steal your happiness, ask for help. 
Let’s… let’s try to be a little kinder to ourselves in 2019, yeah?  
Even when food feels hard, you need to eat.You’re body needs fuel, even if the lies in your head are convincing you otherwise. You don’t have to deserve food. If you’re hungry, there is nothing wrong with eating, no matter how much you’ve had that day.  
Food is necessary and good! no matter what kind of food you end up eating, you’ve done something good.  
food gives you the energy to smile. It gives you the energy to hug your friends or pet cats. It’s like sunlight for a plant- you can’t flourish without it. Let yourself grow 
Just a little reminder that…RESTRICTING will make you feel worse!!!FASTING will make you feel worse!READING LABELS will make you feel worse!WEIGHING YOURSELF will make you feel worse!NONE of these things will solve your problems! They never have before and they never will! 
You deserve to eat, your body deserves nourishment. You are beautiful and you are worth taking care of. If you are looking for permission to eat something, here it is, please eat.. even if it’s small. If you were thinking about food or eating and you saw this, it is a sign you should eat. If you’re feeling hungry, it is a sign you should have something to eat, no matter what or how much you’ve already eaten. You are beautiful and deserving of love and food and weight do not change those facts.  
some recovery things:you may lose friends or have to distance yourself from them. if they have unhealthy habits or are toxic people they can be detrimental to your recovery. it’s okay to let them go. there isn’t necessarily a rock bottom so don’t wait for it to come. only you can decide you want to recover. only you can put that work in. there are certainly people that can be supportive but ultimately it’s your choice and it’s your responsibility.  recovery is a journey. it takes time and for some people it doesn’t necessarily have a finish line. it’s okay to go at your own pace. your recovery might be be slower than someone else’s and that’s okay. sometimes it gets worse, a lot worse, before it gets better. there’s a lot of thoughts and behaviors to unlearn and it’s not easy. you have to make a conscious effort. some days will be better than others and that’s okay. it doesn’t mean you’re failing. it’s okay if you’re not in the place to help someone else.  
Even wanting to want recovery is a step in the right direction. Take a leap of faith. You might fall down, but it won’t hurt nearly as bad in the end.  
bro i can’t wait to feel comfortable in my body 
I am not my body. I am in my body. But I am so much more than my body.  
It’s important to find a purpose and an identity outside your eating disorder. Here are some small examples of things that might help take care of a plant and watch it growlearn how to fix your clothing or other things and start doing itjoin a local community for an interest you enjoy and see how you can help out make jewlery or badges or buttonslearn to knitstart doing the things you used to enjoy as a child write poetry or stories None of these things will fix your eating disorder, but they can make it easier to let go of it. And having practical hobbies that let you see visible results and get positive reinforcement for them can be amazing.  
and realise how very brilliant you are at surviving. Panic attacks, bullying, difficult relationships, physical health problems, mental illness?YOU SURVIVED ITSuicidal thoughts, plans, even attempts?YOU SURVIVED ITNot thinking you could live another day?YOU SURVIVED ITAnything that’s really hard right now?YOU’RE GONNA SURVIVE IT 
your value is not linked to looking a certain way. you can find happiness and meaning outside your eating disorder. 
Happy ThanksgivingYou are allowed to enjoy your food, to eat according to your preferences, to eat to the point of satisfactionYou deserve to enjoy this holiday, however that may look to you (NOT to your ED, or judgmental/unkind relatives)You can eat thanksgiving dinner AND eat breakfast and lunch and snacksYou can eat thanksgiving dinner AND all your meals AND not compensate for it before/after the holidayIt is also okay to struggle with this day and have negative emotions….remember you’re not alone in that. We’re all in this together.If the people around you make harmful comments about food/dieting/eating/anything tbh….It is not meant for you. It does not apply to you.

little helpful things you can do before going to bed:- get a glass of water in case you get thirsty during the night- pack your bag- write a to-do list- plan what you’ll wear tomorrow- make lunch for the next day (& breakfast if you want!)- wash and moisturise your face 
There’s nothing wrong with gaining weight. You are not ugly, you are not weak, you are not a failure. You are beautiful, you are strong, and you are going to be okay. 
Get angry at your eating disorder. You are allowed to be angry. Use your anger to fuel your recovery.  
Everytime a thinspo blog follows me, i think and hope that following me will be their first step towards recovery. I’m cheering on you all! 
we’ll keep going, and we will make things better every day until we aren’t just surviving we’re gonna thrive  
good evening friends, I know some of you are really struggling right now but things will get easier and you will get through it, remember to be kind to yourself and to fight the negative voice in your head, don’t let it win  
Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth.  
you don’t have to make up for large meals, there’s nothing wrong with indulging. You don’t have to punish yourself for it.

one day, when the sun kisses your bare skin, you will no longer fear feeling exposed. the rays will dance on your exposed legs and warm your back with their kind touches. you will laugh as waves splash mist into your face and point out tiny silver fish to your companion and buy ice cream from the little stand on the boardwalk. you will lie in the sunlight in your swimsuit and smile, remembering how far you have come. once upon a time you cried when you looked in the mirror and when you stepped on a scale. you hated every bit of food that crossed your lips and wished you could count your ribs like matchsticks. you could hardly stand to show your face in public, let alone strut half-naked on the beach. but here you are.alive, surviving, recovering, happy. the journey was not an easy one by any means, and there are still hurdles you will have to overcome.but here you are, finally free.

If I lost 50 pounds, I wouldn’t be able to…Take care of my new dogPlay with the kids I babysitWalk to work every dayHave healthy adult relationshipsShow care & support to my partnerGet up the stairs to our apartment Cook nice food and take pics of itMaintain this blog Keep my jobGo on trips overseas Stay in my own homeEat food in any enjoyable mannerSleep, at allLaughAnd honestly in corners of my brain, I’d love to look as sick as possible, BUT at this point in my life there is simply too much to lose; so I stay heavier than I want to be and happier than I ever would be if I were ill.  
When was the last time you made a soothing, well-needed drink and snack just for the sake of enjoying it all by yourselfNot having to seek reason or validation from another being to be able to just simply feel worthy enough to do soWhen was the last time you sat down and allowed yourself to feel loved and feel complete and feel like you don’t need any other external reason to dictate whether you’re worthy of simply enjoying living your own lifeYou’re worthyYou don’t need to have validation, reason, or for it to be a special occasion to be able to enjoy your time and to be nice to yourself. You don’t have to earn self-compassion; not through friendships, work, or any other factor. Food is not a reward, you don’t have to do something or be like someone in order to be able to have it and fully enjoy it. And frankly, you are more than enough.  
The curves on my body are proof I am enjoying my life. With every party, every cake, i’m learning to love my life again. Every curve is a reminder of how good my times were. A reminder of how good they will be. 
You deserve to recover..• if you were never hospitalised• if you still get your period• if you were never technically underweight• if you still ate every day (yes sweetie, you’re still valid)• if you don’t think you’re sick enough (I promise darling, you are)• if you’re underweight, a normal weight, overweight.Anyone and everyone deserves recovery, and you’ll get there one day, I promise ❤️ 
Do everything you can to stay away from toxic communities. That might mean staying away from the internet when you’re feeling vulnerable, deleting blogs you’ve made that are harmful, or avoiding people who are making your issues worse. You don’t owe communities or people who are hurting you anything. Get out of there as soon as you can. You deserve space to heal.  
If you’re reading this, it’s a sign to go eatEven if you don’t think you’re hungry ‘enough’. Even if you think you’ve already ate too many calories.I know how it feels to be anxious about eating and feeling like you don’t deserve the food. Every now and again I get some thoughts telling me not to eat. But please nourish your body, it needs food!Go eat, you deserve it. You deserve good things. 
I apologize for hurting my body when it just wanted to keep me alive :( it’s super cute and makes me happy :)) 
I’m so proud of you if you ate something today. No matter how much you ate, no matter what- eating is good.  
You deserve to travel to another country you’ve always dreamed of visiting. To walk the streets, sipping on a pleasant drink unfamiliar to someone of your culture. To stop for a mid morning and afternoon snack, not because you’re necessarily hungry, but because you see a fantastic baked good in the café window that would bring a smile to your face and please your tourist body and mind. You deserve to sit down for a reservation at a restaurant that appears at the top of the list of best places to eat in that country. To start the meal with a thick slice of their locally baked bread with a slab of butter on top. To order a local favorite you’ve never tried before. To drizzle an unusual but intriguing sauce on top that the waiter swears is to die for. To have the waiter persuade you into taking a local favorite dessert back to your hotel room. To sit in the hotel loveseat facing the window view and eat it slowly, taking in the city. You deserve to travel without an eating disorder. You deserve to live without an eating disorder, and experience every joy life has to offer.  
Ain’t nothing wrong with touching thighs, just look how happy that kitty is to be there!!!Originally posted by cutekittensarefun 
being able to stop making excuses to meet with people in case there’s foodgetting a snack at the cinema just because being less tired feeling confident in your clothing being able to look in the mirror for only as long as you need to check if you look okay and then go about your day seeing your friends smile when you eat somethingcooking food for yourself and not just for others 
Listen, you deserve to be happy. No matter who you are, where you’re from, what you’ve done in the past, and where you’re headed tomorrow - happiness is for all, including you ✨ 
you’ve already done so well. and i am so proud of you for the recovery process you’ve started. relapsing is part of that. don’t give up now, you’ll get there! <3 
Friendly reminder (mostly to myself) that you have a whole bunch of organs n shit all snuggled up inside your abdomen and losing more weight isn’t gonna make them go away!!  Your stomach can’t always be perfectly flat!  Having bumps and pouches on your tummy is literally part of normal human anatomy please don’t be mad at yourself if you can’t have a smooth/flat stomach! 
2019 is the year I finally let myself live again. I’m speaking it into existence.  
Eating disorders are stupid because they make you forget how fucking good a fresh baked brownie is and that’s that.  
{your disorder is lying}{you are enough} 
Eating is a victory. Feeding yourself even though it’s hard is something to celebrate and be proud of.  
{I’m sorry you’re in so much pain.}{You don’t deserve it} 
Your now is not your forever.-John Green  
Me, who knows I deserve recovery regardless: 
Recovery is so so so fucking tough, but I can be tougher. I just have to push and push and push. I refuse to let this disorder take my life from me again. 
It’s been1 whole year of recovery today. Recovering from disordered eating is not an easy path. It is a lot of ups and downs, relapsing, fighting, setbacks and hard work. It’s a slow, slow battle. But I would never want to go back to where I was and I wish to encourage people to follow my lead. Always feel free to message me.  
Yall gotta understand that eating disorders do not discriminate. they can strike at any age, any gender, any size, any race. they aren’t just skinny, white, middle-class teenage girls. not all eating disorders are anorexia and bulimia. binge-eating, EDNOS/OSFED, pica, avoidance, orthorexia…the list goes on. you can’t tell if someone is sick by looking at them. the idea that eating disorders always look a certain way causes so much damage to those who do not fit the stereotypical “ED look.” A major issue I had when getting help was thinking that I wasn’t sick enough to need it. I don’t look like I have an ED, I’m not rail-thin or white or sixteen. I don’t have a traumatic past, I am still mostly functional. I don’t need help because I’m not that bad yet.Bull. Shit.eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. EATING DISORDERS DO NOT HAVE SIZES.you deserve help. you deserve to live your life free from obsessing and worrying and planning and weighing. even if you don’f fit the “type,” even if you think your ED “isn’t that bad.” any amount of ED is bad. any severity deserves to feel better. be brave. be free. 
I am not as thin as I used to be, and that is okay.I no longer can feel my bones jutting out, and that is okay.I no longer have a considerable gap between my legs, and that is okay.It is okay, I am going to be okay. 
Reasons to eat regularly and keep eating regularly1. To be engaged in my life2. To have the energy to enjoy exercising3. To be able to go out for meals and not be overwhelmed by anxiety over the food4. To not be thinking about food all. the. time.5. To feel warm
If you don’t like your body and catch yourself getting caught in a thought spiral about how much you don’t like your body: get out of your head and do something with your body.Draw a picture, take a walk, heck, throw some rocks around if you can.  Life gets better when you stop caring about what your body looks like and start appreciating what it can do. 
The number on the scale does not mean I will stop eating.The number on the scale does not mean I will stop trying to love myself.The number on the scale does not mean I am a failure.

The sun is up, the sky is blue, it’s beautiful, and so are you 🌼 
In case you needed reminding: Healing is not a linear process. 
ice cream is the best thing in the world and i hope y’all allow yourselves to enjoy it all you want because you deserve it 💛🍦 
This time last year I seriously thought I would have to go the rest of my life living like that. But here I am as a testament that it will be okay. You will be okay. 
just some concept playlists pt. 1I hug you and bury my face in your neck. It’s been a hard day, I feel sick, but I can feel your heartbeat with mine, I can hold you close and pretend that we’re the only thing in this world. Because right now, you and I, we’re the only thing that matters.It’s the 5th day of school after summer, you’re in math class and the cute girl you kinda sorta have a crush on has to work with you and your friend on a small project.Going through a breakup, recovering and learning to love yourself, for the first time or all over again. Things will be okay, just give it time.You’ve just run away, its 5:30am and you’re drinking bad motel coffee while watching the sunrise, you can hear the cars on the nearby highway and everything seems alright for onceYou’re walking around your old hometown with a friend. It’s a cool summer evening, and the sunset is bright behind the dry hills that you can see in the distance. You want to capture this feeling because you know you’ll have to leave soon, and don’t know when you’ll be there again.Every minute feels like an hour, every hour feels like a day, every day feeling like forever, but it’s okay because I’ll wait forever and a day for you.You feel lonely but you make someone smile and you remember why you’re here. It’s lonely, it’s scary, but it will all be okay. Just keep going.EMERGENCY POSITIVITY BELOW! You know how amazing you are? So freaking amazing that the universe had to give you some bad days because you were getting Too Powerful! You’re so lovely you practically glow! Everyone around you can’t help but stare. You deserve so much love, so stay safe and kick ass.

eating is a victory. celebrate it.  
Messages to those struggling with an Eating Disorder from someone in recovery***disclaimer that I am in no way a professional therapist. I am simply speaking from my own experience with ED recovery and struggling with an eating disorder***-I’m so proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for staying strong. I’m proud of you for being alive. I love you-it doesn’t matter how much weight you have or haven’t lost, if you are hurting your body you are hurting it period. You don’t need to lose a specific amount of weight to have an eating disorder. It is classified as a MENTAL disorder for a reason. You are valid no matter what and just because someone’s disorder may look “worse” than yours doesn’t mean yours isn’t bad. I don’t care what you say, you are VALID.-you deserve recovery no matter what. You hear me? NO MATTER WHAT.-If you say you “haven’t been sick long enough” Nonono you can recover whenever. WHENEVER! Eating disorders aren’t linear. You don’t have to be sick for a certain amount of time to considered “officially sick”. There is no “time spent suffering” requirement. You could be damaging yourself as soon as you start engaging in behaviors. You are valid and you deserve to get help whether it started weeks ago or years ago.-If a doctor says you can’thave an eating disorder because you aren’t underweight go to another doctor. Fuck them. Fuck anyone who says that to you. That’s not true at all. Throughout my whole eating disorder I never once looked sick. I was never once underweight. But I was so sick mentally. Please don’t let anyone tell you those horrible things. It’s just not true and doctors and psychologists have proven that it’s not true. -Your disorder is still valid even if no one sees it. I see it. I hear you. I’ve been there. You are still valid no matter what. You still deserve help. I love you.-No, you aren’t the only one these rules DON’T apply to. Even if you don’t believe it, this applies to you.-No matter what mistakes or failures you have made in your life, you never deserve to hurt yourself. -You will NOT be nothing without your disorder. You have amazing characteristics that are just being masked by the disorder. If you were to recover, you would find new amazing passions and skills you never even knew you had. You will not be nothing without your disorder. You will be everything. -Recovery is so scary and so hard, it means facing your worst fears. Believe me I know. But once you get over that initial hurdle and start healing mentally and physically, it gets easier. I swear 100% it gets easier. Your life gets better. You feel alive again. You feel free. You feel liberated. You feel like you could dance in a field of wildflowers. -For most people, eating disorders develop because you don’t want to face the pain and trauma in your life so you use it as a coping skill to numb yourself. And once you realize that it can make recovery even more scary. Will I be in even more pain? What do I do if it becomes too much to deal with? I promise you that facing your pain is a lot less scary than it seems. Yes it is hard and heartbreaking and terrible. But destroying yourself with a disorder isn’t going to fix it, it isn’t going to make that pain go away. Temporarily yes, but it will always be there until you face it. Your disorder isn’t helping you. It’s going to hurt you even more than you’re already hurting.-Relapses will happen, even if you’ve been in recovery for years. BUT, they do NOT mean your progress has been erased. You have hit a speed bump not a road block. And you will be strong enough to get through it. I believe in you.-When you have an eating disorder you miss out on life. I don’t remember anything good about my life last year. All I can remember is counting calories, crying, and purging. You deserve to enjoy life. You deserve all the good things in life. You don’t deserve to suffer at all. -Your eating disorder will do nothing but hurt you and destroy you, it makes you miserable and sad. Skinny doesn’t equal happy no matter what! I promise you it doesn’t. You wanna know what does make you happy? Eating ice cream with friends. Enjoying the taste of chocolate. Being able to go out to eat and not have to google the menu beforehand. Not having to count calories every single day and night. Not crying over food. Being able to enjoy living and not constantly destroying yourself. No matter who you are, you never deserve an eating disorder. Even if you feel like you do, even if you feel like a failure or disgusting or a loser. You will NEVER EVER deserve that disorder as a punishment. You wanna know what is disgusting? The disorder. You wanna know who’s beautiful and strong and amazing? YOU. Please never ever forget that.  -Recovery is possible and always an option, and you will always always deserve it. 
it’s almost New Years and I know that a lot of people will make it their resolution to lose weight. but really? that’s not a good resolution. it doesn’t help the world become a better place. it doesn’t help you become a better person. this year, please don’t make it your goal to become smaller. if you’re going to make a New Years resolution, make it something that brings love into this world instead of more hate and fatphobia and support to an industry that profits off our insecurities. instead you could try deciding to:- unfollow any thinspo/fat shaming/negative accounts- eat when you are hungry- stop looking at calorie content for food- stop negative self talk and replace it with positive self talk- follow positive accountsor if you want something that’s not realated to food/weight at all, maybe:- compliment people more often (and maybe try to keep it away from compliments on someone’s body and weight)- read more- send a kind message to someone every day- reach out when you need help- call people out on bigoted comments or languagethere are a million resolutions you could make to bring a positive influence into the world, and losing weight is not one of them. 
hey there. have you eaten something today? I’m so proud of you if you have. if you haven’t, please do, you deserve it too. 
you ever eat just to flex on your eating disorder 
I didn’t choose recovery once,, i have to choose it everyday. and if i relapse i can’t let it affect my choice tomorrow…you gotta leave it in yesterday and take the new day in ur hands and say “today i choose recovery!”  
Glorify recoveryGlorify full meals, a good nights rest, and doing your best. Glorify making the consious decision to be better. Glorify the daily struggles to do whats best and ignore the evil whispers your disorder wants you to trust. Glorify winning those little, silent victories. Glorify feeling warm, full, and refreshed. Glorify health and happiness and caution. Recovery can be beautiful if we rest during our bad days and rejoice on our good days. Weather you are moving up or down, you are still moving forward. Glorify recovery, not illness.  
2019 is the year I become a kitchen witch and start feeding myself properly and magically. 
I promised my therapist I wouldn’t become one in five. It’s a frightening statistic that rings true. One in five with an eating disorder will either commit suicide or die from the medical complications of their illness. On days where I can’t find any other reason to choose recovery, I choose it to not break my promise to her.  
Just tryna be proud of my body :-) 
throughout my recovery, i have done every single one of my fear foods. fast food is the one thing that i have not been able to do and haven’t had in over 10 years. today, i said a big “fuck you” to my eating disorder and did it. i am so fuckin proud.  
Less than a week into recovery and I have so much more energy!!! I haven’t painted in months and I had the energy to paint two animals in just a day. Yes, recovery is HARD and I look like I’m 20 months pregnant from all the bloating but honestly? It’s worth it. I’m so much happier. Fuck my ed. I hope he chokes on all the bread I’ve been munching on ✌️ 
Over the past months I’ve managed to:- usually eat three meals a day- get used to drinking calories (next to eating them)- stabilize my weight (including a healthy bmi)- limit excessive exercising- stop weighing every day/multiple times a day- stopped purging- try some new foods and fear foods- (mostly) get over my fear of proteinsAnd all that without help from the eating disorder facility because those ass fucks dropped my case or something.I can do this by myself. I am my own biggest supporter. I am done with my eating disorder and I can live without it.  
{there is more to life than being skinny} 
Recovery feels so much better 😊 
What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being. 
Split.A part of me still feels like I don’t deserve “recovery.”A part of me feels like I didn’t even have a problem to recover from.A part of me feels like I failed because I never reached my goal weight.A part of me feels like I’ll run back to my old habits, sooner or later.A part of me wants that part of me to shrink to nothing.A part of me wants that part of me to stay. 
You deserve to eat. You deserve to be healthy. You deserve self care. You deserve to live.  
You ate today? You stayed hydrated? Got enough sleep? Proud of u!!!!  
yo….. anorexia takes the shit u love and crushes it. dont trust the bitch. 
Fuck anorexia and the idea that I would only be good enough when I was thin

Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 
Sometimes I feel guilty about treating myself to something like a little peanut butter on my toast if I haven’t ‘earned’ it by doing extra exercise or something and let me tell you,you don’t have to earn eating anything.  You deserve to treat yourself even if you haven’t done anything extra to earn it. 
Today marks 3 months since I decided to recover. It’s definitely been hard, and had its ups and downs, but honestly thank god I decided to recover. Who knows where I’d be at today if I hadn’t. 
All in all, today I’ve been able to enjoy my recovery by eating what I wanted, not what my eating disorder wanted. For breakfast I had chocolate oats, for lunch a hummus avocado wrap, and for dinner some homemade pesto pasta! I enjoyed every second of every meal. Here to a long, amazing life full of good food and art ✨
i want to fall in love with being aliveand one day, i will 
I’m not fully recovered, but I’m so much happier than I used to be. It really does get better 
A lil sunburn and a lil acne but we’re thriving in this beautiful weather 🌼 feeling really good and confident today!   
I know anorexia recovery isn’t about the weight. But sometimes it feels like it is. Some days in recovery, all you can see, all you can feel, is your body and how it’s changed. It feels impossible to live with. It feels like accepting your “new” body will never happen. And it does. Slowly, over time. A little over two years ago, I wrote a post about struggling to accept my body. I was four months post-treatment the second time. I had weight-restored to a higher weight than I had the first time around, and I was sure that I wouldn’t make it. And I did. I took the energy I had previously put into losing weight and applied it to recovery instead. I went to therapy, I ate my meals and snacks, I didn’t relapse into restriction, over-excercise, or purging. I did the hard things. Here I am today, just two years later, living life completely symptom-free, accepting my body as it is, even loving it at times. I used to give my power away, to allow the number on the scale to define my worth and value. I have taken that power back. I define myself by what I love. I find myself to be inherently worthy, simply because I’m human. I didn’t know this kind of life was out there waiting for me. And it was. And it’s waiting for you too. 
Life is so much better when you can go eat some crackers or cookies when you’re hungry in the middle of the night.   
It’s okay if your trauma didn’t make you a better person.It’s okay if your trauma didn’t make you stronger. It’s okay if it didn’t help you grow. If it didn’t make you a better person. YOUR STORY IS STILL VALID. You are still an inspiration. You’re still every bit as brave for being here today than anyone else. You don’t owe anyone anything. Trauma doesn’t always lead to strength and growth and becoming a better person at the end of the day. If something ruined your life, or changed it for the worse, you’re allowed to say it did. Not every bad experience turns into something good. You’re still every bit as much a hero of your own story as anyone else. Don’t let anyone tell you your trauma needs to result in something good. You are not your trauma. You do not need to include it into your story if you don’t want to. You do not need to appease anyone and say you’re stronger because of it.  
bowl full of self love <3 
friendly reminder that you made it until this point in your life. you went through so many struggles and you’re still here. i’m so proud of you, keep fighting 🌞💛💫🌻 
Eating a little more than you planned to/ eating some extra dessert doesn’t mean you’ve ruined your day. It doesn’t mean that you’re going to gain a bunch of weight. It doesn’t mean you should go and eat as much of whatever you can think of because you believe you’ve already messed up so you might as well throw everything else away. What it does mean is that you let yourself indulge a little and that’s ok. 
This message honestly MADE MY DAY <3 I’m so glad I was able to give you a new perspective. Eating is a way to honor your body and nourish your spirit. The eating disorder can never take that magic from you. Keep fighting love. 
“The people who don’t get better from an eating disorder are the ones who stop trying.” —Carolyn Costin and Gwen Grabb, 8 Keys to Recovery 
Recover so you can eat candy without being scared anymore 
I’ve been stuffed with five meals a day for several days in a row and I haven’t gotten fat yet. So in conclusion: if u ate/have to eat some meal today that you worry about, it’s cool - we’ll be ok, you and I. We’ve places to be and things to do but we gotta eat first🍵🌺 
Since it’s NEDA week, I’ve thought that I would reflect on this topic because weight redistribution is a real thing in recovery, yet not a lot of posts are written about it. It’s probably because when it happens and the weight redistributes, most of the sufferers are at a stage in their recovery mentally when they really let go of the disordered thoughts and the whole obsession with body checking, thus they don’t even notice the change. Yet, I was very conscious about my body throughout this whole transformation and I did notice the change. I just never sat down to write about it but now half a year after my weight redistributed, I can say that it’ll happen to you, too, just give it time, give your body time to heal properly.Those who know my story know that I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in 2017 March. I gained weight and lost weight during that year, my weight fluctuated a lot because I was still not fully committed to recovery. It wasn’t until later that year when I also broke free from a toxic friendship that I committed fully to recovery both mentally and physically. I was seeing my psychologist frequently while extreme hunger hit stronger than ever. I gained even more weight than before, I looked like a pregnant girl sometimes because all the weight accumulated around my stomach area and on my face. I looked like I was bloated all the time, yet I knew that I had to give it my all, especially because I wasn’t the best recovery warrior I could be. I wanted to do my best this time and doing my best meant eating properly, eating whenever, whatever and how much ever I wanted.So I did. It was scary, probably one of the scariest things I’ve had to done my whole life and the changes in my body didn’t help either. Though I have to admit that I was talking with my eldest sister about it one day and she said that she didn’t even notice the weight gain, so just know that it’s probably not as prominent as you think. Even if it is, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, you’re healing, your body is healing. I know how frightening it is, I also cried myself to sleep a lot of times, asking if I’ll always look this way, if I’ll always feel so utterly hungry.Yet, time went by and I gained confidence while gaining weight and I just let go of the obsession around my weight. I became less stressed due to the fact that I was over my exams, so I had the whole summer to focus on something rather than my body and weight. I traveled a lot, met up with a lot of lovely people and made many, many wonderful memories. And yes, I also ate a lot of good food while not even realizing the shift in my mind-set. The extreme hunger wasn’t there anymore, it just disappeared. It happened so naturally, and I found my body going back to its set point without me interfering. I didn’t bloat anymore, my face wasn’t so puffy and my jeans fit the same as they did before the weight gain. I was also weighed when I was registered at a new doctor (as I’ve turned an adult that year), and my weight really went back to its pre-ED state. What matters more is that I had energy, I had a healthy menstrual cycle, my hair was growing rapidly and healthily and I could enjoy life as it was.Ever since then, I didn’t see a change in my weight. I don’t know my weight anymore as we don’t have a scale in the flat where I live currently for my uni studies, but jeans fit me the same. It wasn’t an easy road, it took my body around a year and half to find its healthy place and for it to trust me again but it functions properly again, and I couldn’t have been more thankful for it.So if you are going through it, if you are hesitating to start real recovery, I’m telling you to do it! It’s scary, hell, it’s really scary, but it’s so worth it! More about it later this week. :) 
Been feeling pretty insecure in my body lately, so these are from over the summer when I was more confident, but I wanted to participate in body positive selfie night!! This is something that’s really special to me, as I’m learning to love myself the way I am and say f*ck you to my eating disorder. 
The little voice in my head that tells me I’m too much and yet not enough, doesn’t get to rule my life anymore!!! I’m perfectly imperfect and I’m beautiful at the size I’m supposed to be 💕🦋🙌🏻 
Choose recovery every day  
Ok but y'all have no idea how confused I am about how eating normally has changed my body?????? Like bitch I haven’t gotten fat??? My chest bones are still right there but now I have muscles too??? I can see my abs??? I workout so little here and I eat all day long????????¿¿??? mY L1fE iS a LiE 
2019I’m so ready to leave this stupid ass eating disorder in 2018 where it belongs. I’m so sick of dealing with this shit for TEN YEARS NOW. I’m done, over it, finished. Goodbye. See you never. 
{please eat}{healing takes energy} 
So I’ve gained almost 30 pounds since I started recovery and guess what. ..Nothing happened. The world didn’t collapse in on itself. My fiancé didn’t leave me. I didn’t have to drop out of college due to embarrassment. My friends didn’t stop wanting to be seen with me. And literally not ONE person has made a comment about my body changing, aside from those who knew it needed to. I’m not saying everything is better. I’m still not comfortable in my body most of the time and the ED thoughts haven’t stopped. But the world is confirming for me that those thoughts have been wrong. And they always will be, so keep going. 
Haven’t weighed myself in over a week and I’m a constant ball of anxiety BUT Y’ALL. Look dat smile. Dat shit genuine. 🙌🏻 
i think i might be ready to start eating normally again. i’m done with being afraid of food, i’m done with passing out, i’m done with being dizzy all the time, i’m done with being so cold it hurts, i’m done with lying to all my friends and family. it will be rough, but i’m going to try to get better. 
🌸🧬💘💓Life really is too short to be worrying about how my body looks and what I eat. It’s time to just be happy and free and enjoy this life🌸🧬💘💓 
Been really struggling with my eating disorder lately, but trying my best to love the skin I’m in. Big shoutout to @taylorswift for writing this 💕 
Here’s to another day aka another chance to learn to love yourself the way you are ❤️ 
For years, I was in denial about how much of a problem my eating disorder had become. I pushed it further and further down, which ultimately only made me get sicker. This summer was my first time at a treatment program, my first time putting recovery first. It definitely hasn’t been easy; I’ve always been an overachiever/perfectionist, and I can be incredibly hard on myself for not having my book finished, not working full-time, not being where I want to be in my career. However, now I’m starting to realize that if I don’t put my recovery first right now, I’ll never be well enough to achieve all these goals I have in the future. Today I choose recovery so that I can have many, many tomorrows to follow my dreams. 
Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do.It is not a punishment for what you have eatena way to compensate for “extra” calories or just a means to lose weight.No matter where you’re starting at, enjoy the process and be kind to your body, you deserve it.  
🌱 positive affirmations 🌱🍃 I am worthy of love in my life.🍃 I am brilliant, badass and beautiful.🍃 I am strong enough to get through.🍃 I am resilient - the world will not get me down.🍃 The opinion of others does not shape who I am, I shape who I am.🍃 I can do anything I set my mind to and I intend to do great things.🍃 I am ready to receive the good that is coming to me - I deserve good things. 
Do not restrict today!Do not compensate tomorrow!We can do this! 
Friendly PSA: your purpose in life is not to serve your eating disorder. Your purpose in life is to learn, love, grow, and help others and yourself. You can’t do any of those things if you’re actively reducing yourself and minimizing the space you occupy. You aren’t meant to be a list of numbers. You are meant to be a force to be reckoned with. An active eating disorder is incompatible with an active life well-lived. Do not listen to its lies.  
recovery is hard. today i went to the store and bought  some food, but decided that i would instead eat an entire jar of biscoff spread. i’m not going to purge, but i wanna just say this because i’ve been feeling pretty relapse-y lately because my clothes no longer fit. it’s okay if you have bad days. if you’re following this blog because you’re serious about recovery, i’m proud of you. i love you all.  
Sometimes listening to your body is really fucking hard and it sucks. These last few days I’ve been so hungry and it’s been really hard to listen to my hunger and eat. But I’m doing it. Because choosing to eat intuitively is not just about ‘stopping when you’re full!’ as the media likes to paint it these days. It’s also about eating more when you’re still hungry. 
all my people thinking of recovering or in recovery right now- i’m so proud of you, i love you, i believe in you. you can do this. stay strong and stay proud ♥️🥀 
what kind of vile creature do you have to be to post thinspo and toxic ed thoughts in the ed RECOVERY tag? like, i go to this tag when i want to reassure myself that i’m doing the right thing and you put some underweight pictures up and yell at the world that starving’s the best. look, i’ve been there, i get it, anorexia sucks; that’s why  we DON’T WANT TO GET BACK THERE, SO LET US BE. jeeeeez.i’ve seen so many polite posts about this but, dude, every time i see some ~*thinspo*~ in the tag i start cursing like a sailor. it’s just so mother effin RUDE. 
For every meal, I ate a fear food, and I’m so proud! Hello again, recovery. 
Congratulations, my loves! You made it through 2018! I am so proud of you, this year threw a lot of things at you, and you fought through it with bravery. I cannot wait to see what you do in 2019! 
it’s National Eating Disorder Awareness Week. year after year, i struggle to find the words to say. every sixty two minutes this illness will take someone’s life. so this year, i’d like to take time to celebrate those who have made it through the sixty two minutes over and over again. healing is a lifelong journey.with that being said, what’s sad is that as i write this and people read it, a majority will still engage in diet culture crap, body/food shaming (of yourself or others), fitness routines for unhealthy reasons, negative self talk…and a slew of other “socially acceptable because it’s the norm even though it’s actually kinda disordered” type of behaviors and mentalities around food, body, and exercise. recovering from an eating disorder in a disordered eating centered society can feel like the most paradoxical thing ever.we’ve come far as a society in making change and raising awareness but we still have ways to go. i look forward to the day where there is affordable treatment, lower mortality rates, better prevention/education programs, and more stories of hope. i also can’t wait for a culture that is inclusive for ALL bodies and places less judgments and value on body size & food, and instead focuses on how loving & kind we all are. 
In honor of it being National Eating Disorder Awareness week, I want you to know that you are not alone. That if you’re fighting this battle day after day - I see you. I hear you. I am with you. Being more open about my struggles with mental illness has been one of the most uncomfortable and scariest things to do. But it has also brought me growth, understanding, and acceptance towards my illness. Though I say it with reluctance and fear of judgement, I struggle with an eating disorder and have for almost a decade. This disorder is blind and it does not choose favorites. You can be any age, weight, race, gender, religion, social standing, etc. Mental illness does not care who you are and it’s important that people know it can affect anyone. Recovery is undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced. I actively have to choose it on a daily basis and some days are harder than others. Though I fall many times, I will always rise because the strength in me is tougher than what tries to break me. Fight today for a better tomorrow. Work hard now for a better future. This illness does not have to take you down with it. So come as you are and let yourself be the beautiful person that you are. If you are struggling and need more help, please contact ‭+1 (800) 931-2237‬ 💙💚 
goodbye ❤️ [15.05.19]idk how many people will see this but i finally started recovering -a while ago- -before it was too late- which explains my absence. im currently in such a better place and mindset and i couldn’t be more glad that i chose recovery.i’ve started watching a youtuber called jen brett and she literally helped me so much. she used to suffer from an eating disorder and her channel is mostly revolved around her life in recovery. she’s such a positive influence and i recommend her to anyone who needs motivation to recover 💗looking back at my old posts on this blog absolutely breaks my heart. it physically hurts how much i hated my body and myself. i don’t deserve that and nobody does. i was so obsessed with counting calories it took over my entire life and i got too distracted. i can’t believe i voluntarily chose a route that could have possibly led to my own grave for the sole reason of pleasing society which cannot even be pleased.the reason why i chose recovery? well i didn’t really choose it at first. finals were coming up so i had to eat properly so i could concentrate on studying. but i promised myself i’d go back to my habits once this finals were over.and they were, but while i was trying to go back to my old habits and struggling with body image issues in the process, i stumbled upon said youtuber, jen brett, and her channel completely changed my thoughts. im now eating in a way people can call “intuitive”. im listening to my body when it’s hungry and im exercising when i want to. i’ve gotten so much happier this way and my relationship with food has gotten a lot better.i realised that restricting myself was just gonna make me go into the cycle of restricting and binging over and over again with no actual progress or positive impact. i was in such a constant battle with my body and what it wants and it was so mentally exhausting. i recommend this to anyone who is struggling from an eating disorder and i hope you all find your way into recovery at some point.im so much happier now and im trying my best to stay away from eating disorder-related social media posts on all platforms so that i can proceed on to my recovery with no set backs.with that being said, im deactivating. so goodbye ED community but i can’t say i’ll miss you because this literally feels like leaving jail lmao. i hope you all leave soon too 💓 
Y'all know what I did today?? 😎😎😎 I chose my own snack 💪💪💪 that’s right folks 👍👍 I thought about what I wanted, decided on it, picked it up and ate it 😼😼😼 Up until today, I have been completely unable to decide on what I should eat, but today during the last snack, I wanted an apple and I had one BOOM pr0GrEsSSs 🙌🙌🙌 
ugh sometimes recovery means making the same realizations over and over and over again until finally your brain is like “huh I guess I actually need to do something about this” and it is so painful but those realizations are important. No matter how many breakdowns and tear-filled nights I have, I’m still feeling and processing and even if it really is the same shit again and again, I have to trust that this will lead to something better.  
It is absolutely exhausting to go through life hating yourself. To over analyze everything you do, think, feel. To replay and beat yourself up over moments that seem so significant but in reality, can’t be remembered in weeks, months, and years to come. How can we live a prosperous, healthy, and happy life if we spend so much time drowning in our own misery? How many times will I have to chose recovery and a better life before it finally sticks? I challenge all of you to let go of whatever mental illness(es) or shackles that are holding you down - kepeing you trapped in your old ways. This year, I want to let go of my perfectionism, my eating disorder, and work on my anxiety and OCD. 🌼 I want to bloom in 2019. Don’t you? 🌼 
To young people with poor body images:There’s no “just this once”There’s no “I’ll stop when I reach my goal”There’s no “This is unhealthy but it’ll make me healthier in the long run”There’s no “I can stop when I want to stop”There’s no “I’ll only restrict by a couple hundred calories”There’s no way to make yourself happy engaging in disordered eating habits. You will always want more—you will always want to be smaller, to have smaller portions, to feel more empty. Don’t trust bloggers or journalists or friends or the voices in your head that tell you this is what you need to do to be happy.Don’t make yourself do something that will take you a lifetime to recover from. Talk to someone you trust, exercise for reasonable amounts of time, eat around 2000 calories a day (even more if you exercise heavily), you NEVER need to feel shame for the things you eat. Your body is good because it is living, because it carries your soul, its shape has no effect on that goodness and worth. 
Thoughts I have to remind myself that not every day is a war. My plate isn‘t a battlefield and my body is no villain. It isn’t okay to eat unhealthy because I will eat healthy the next few days - it’s okay to eat unhealthy because I am human and I love to eat pizza. It’s okay because two bananas and three chocolate chips aren’t a binge which I have to erase with a following day of eating less. This way of living, the constant thought about what I eat and how I can reach my goal just to eat more and try it the next day again isn’t normal. It’s not healthy and I don’t deserve this. Nobody deserves this. I have to remind myself that I am allowed to relax. Not just for today but forever. It seems unreal but I am allowed to end this battle in my head just by ending it. Today, My thoughts are stopping me from letting them go- but i hope that someday I am able to leave the battlefield.  
I want to say that this isn’t me being brave, that this is just me living & it’s totally normal & I’m 100% happy and confident in this body. 
But, at this point in my journey, that just isn’t the truth. This is the scariest picture I’ve ever posted & doing so is giving me so much anxiety. I’ve tried to post tummy photos before, but they’re still all saved in my drafts &, for some crazy reason, I clicked post on this one. It only takes 5 seconds of insane courage to change anything right? Well here’s that little bit of courage. 
I think the main reason I’m posting this is because this is what I needed to see when I was growing up, & even now I still need to see this. If I grew up seeing the way people really looked, I wouldn’t have been so ashamed of my body, & I probably wouldn’t have learned to view food as such a bad thing. It’s been a long, hard, painful journey to get to this point in my life & I’ve done some serious damage to my body, but now I’m learning to love it & to take care of it.
And now I want to see all sorts of different sizes & types of people. That’s how it is in all of nature, yet somehow society decided to change it all in a blink of an eye. Take a moment & look around you. There are so many dogs, flowers, cats, trees, mountains, bodies of water, & more that all look so different, & yet we think all humans should look the same? That doesn’t make sense & that’s not how it works. So take off society’s glasses & learn to love, accept and support yourself & the people around you, no matter their size, shape or belief system, really no matter what!
I’m slowly letting myself come to the knowledge and conclusion that I’m fucking bomb as fuck and that fact has NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW I LOOK. It’s nice to look in the mirror on a day when I feel not very attractive and be like “oooo bitch you’re fuckin dope” because I’m worthy and amazing regardless of my weight, appearance, whatever! It’s been a struggle for me before to think that people will like being around me if I look like shit but honestly, if people care about my ability to look good instead of my personality, that’s their fuckin problem!!  
I may be wearing all black for work but I feel almost…content with my body today???  
I’m gonna be so happy. I’ll make lemonade and chill all day long and make some funky music bc I’m gonna be ok. I’ll take my dorky pup and even dorkier lad out camping and I’ll finally paint my lame desk. I’m also gonna make a cake every month bc as it turns out, I’m all about cake🌼 
what does the “healthiest” version of your self look like? does it include: toned “abs,” protein in everything, compulsive exercise, thin hair, forced smiles? what about: nourishment, indulgence, fitness, rest, luscious hair, true joy, balance? my healthiest self may not be my thinnest or my fittest self, but i have to believe it will be my happiest self.  
even though yesterday sucked, there was some progressi didn’t get blackout drunki didn’t go to buy more alcoholi didn’t self-harmi ate breakfast/didn’t restrict this morning to compensate 
here’s the deal, friends. we lovin ourselves in 2019. we recovering in 2019. we still losing weight but in a healthy way. im tired of hating myself, its exhausting. i encourage all of u to join me, but if u cant its okay. ily bebs. 
12/24🌱keep having to remind myself, i’m not an anorexic who’s failing, i’m a person who’s succeeding  
so i’m a part of an ED recovery group on facebook. and i mentioned in MY OWN POST, my very own personal post, (i just want to make it clear i didnt invade or side track anybody else’s post) that trans people have a higher risk of developing eating disorders, and being trans and having an ED, i wish more people would speak up and research this and be aware.and somebody had the audacity to say something along the lines of “I have many trans friends and none of them have eating disorders so i dont think this is true”.and another person was basically like, “hey, theres not that many trans people anyways so its not worth spreading awareness”and just stupid stupid arguments.i so so wish i had screenshotted before the post got taken down due to the arguing but like. i’m so so upset about this. all i gotta say is, there is no fucking harm in spreading awareness about these things. theres literally no harm. so why are you fucking derailing my post and trying to silence me????Like i literally don’t care if you think that’s more important to focus on AFAB people with EDs (most people will say “women” but statistics point to it being a biological thing, which includes all AFAB people). When you come out and say “this is more important so lets talk about this instead”, what you’re saying to me is “trans people don’t matter to me and i dont care that they’re at risk”.these people, these comments derailing my posts, are explicitly transphobic. i dont care if they claim they arent, deep down the reason theyre saying these things is because they don’t care about trans rights or awareness of trans issues. and that’s bullshit.i’m so sick of my identity being shamed on, i’m so tired of trying to speak up for my gender because NO ONE ELSE WILL and then just being shushed away.I WILL NOT BE SILENCED.TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. MY IDENTITY MATTERS. AWARENESS ABOUT MY HEALH RISKS MATTER. THESE THINGS FUCKING MATTER BECAUSE TRANS PEOPLE MATTER.anyways thanks for coming to my v aggressive TED talk. and take this as a not so friendly reminder that trans people fucking matter and need to be protected at all costs. 
I realised that I WANT to live, just not with my ED. So if I don’t want me dead, and don’t want my anorexia (fuck that bitch) so I NEED to recover. This is that simple. I want to feed my body and kill my sickness, not feed my sickness and kill my body.please reblog, if u dont want to recover, I feel bad for u, but it may help others 
honestly y’all, wholly and truly dedicating yourself to your recovery is the best decision you could ever make and don’t let your ed tell you otherwise. im so much healthier and happier now than i ever was with an ed 
I went to a party and I got a little upset because there was that very beautiful and very skinny girl and I compared myself to her and put myself down. But then I went to the bathroom and I looked into the mirror and then I thought “I don’t look like her but I look pretty cute myself”. And it made me really happy.  
anywayi am finally ready to recover and beat this ana bitch because i believe life has so much to give me that i don’t have time to stare in the mirrors and critisize my beautiful body, which is perfect, yes, i said it is fine just the way it is, like every.single.body. 
!!!!! Ya boi maintained a healthy weight for 3+ months!!! It didn’t even fluctuate by more than a tiny bit, I’m so proud. My weight kept changing by a lot very fast and we were worried about it. Gaining weight was scary but weirdly the scary part became going back down in weight sometimes, because it proved I was going back to bad habits. But I maintained a normal weight for my body and my confidence has gone up! 
Today someone offered me a piece of cake. I said yes, and without a second thought, I ate the cake.Only after did it occur to me that I have not done that in about two years since my eating disorder.I never realize how much progress I’m making in my recovery until things like this happen, especially this time.That is all. 
so I told my mom that I wanted ice cream earlier (especially since I had already eaten very little today so I was super hungry). she then went to the store and bought ice cream. I told her not to (because it’s a fear food) but she did anyway.after crying a bunch, I ate the whole little cup. granted it had a bunch of calories and it really freaked me out, I managed to make it through. I’m trying not to let the guilt sink in too much, especially since its almost 1am and I have no idea what we’re eating tomorrow but oh well. I’ll live, right? Haha well that was my little recovery win: eating Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from blue bunny 💛😊 
imagine how much nicer winter will be without restriction. How nice it will be to add sugar to your tea or drink hot cocoa on cold nights. Imagine the nights spent with friends and how much nicer it’ll be when you’re not thinking about how your body feels when they hug you. You deserve that now, no matter what your weight. 
I’m going back to college after leaving before my sophomore year. It’s been 4 years!!A lot has happened since then. And now I’m a different person. When I left school, I was severely depressed, suicidal, in the middle of an eating disorder, lost and scared. Then I slowly started to find my own way.Now I am in recovery, I’m no longer suicidal, I know what I’m capable of and I’m no longer lost. I’m louder, I speak up for myself, I fight and work hard for what I want. I don’t wish for things to happen, I make it happen. I am completely different. And I’m thankful for all of the experiences that has led me to the person I am today.I am starting another lengthy chapter in this story of my life. I’m both excited and anxious, but I’m doing it anyways. 
The HARDEST part about recovering from an eating disorder is learning to be okay with changing your body shape. Learning to be okay with gaining extra weight and having a softer face and a rounder torso takes so much effort, because you have to take time to unlearn everything that you’ve taught yourself about your image and about food, and you have to start learning how to eat for yourself again. Having an extra scoop of ice cream or that small snack you’ve been secretly looking forward to might seem miniscule to others, but I understand how important that is to those of us in recovery.I see how much effort you’re making, and I’m so proud of you  
I think im going to recovery, im so tired of hating myself  
a few months ago I couldnt even consider eating avocados and here I am now, enjoying the avocado life again♥ 
Trying to flood my dashboard with positivity rn!So please, if you post self-love and acceptance stuff and/or ED recovery, reblog or like this post so that I can follow you!I’m feeling really down and beat atm, so I just kinda need some positivity in my life 
Yes. Yes. And YESSS! I struggle with this C O N S T A N T L Y. I essentially ask my treatment team at each appointment if I reallllyyyy have a problem or if they are just listening to me ramble because it’s their job. To which, they always respond that I know the answer. That I know I am sick. That the voice in your head telling you that you aren’t sick enough is the eating disorder voice. That is not you. You are worthy of treatment and happiness and a FULL recovery and unburdened life. You wouldn’t wait until your cancer was stage 4 to treat it, so why would you need to be ANY weight to have these intrusive thoughts. We don’t assess depression by something absurd like hours spent sleeping or degree of dehydration from crying. An eating disorder is no different. I think you and I both know this, BUT the ED voice can be so so powerful we need reassurance and reminders that it is a problem because of how I feel not how I look. As for the meal plan, mine is not currently fpcused on a change in caloric amount, but a change in the timing/routine (aka still eating a meal or snack after something triggering happens). So I’m not yet experiencing the physical discomfort associated with nutritional rehabilitation… I’m stuck on working through the emotional distress of having to maintain any kind of structured plan that doesn’t take into account how I am feeling or what upsetting events might have happened. I should add, it has been 2 days since setting this out and it is already a lofty goal. I am already struggling. Some things that help are preemptively having an action plan for what I will tell myself to follow the meal plan and relaxation/distraction techniques to get through it. I also have a really hard time disobeying people so it’s hard because I don’t want to disappoint them. Like them saying I have to makes me feel like I have permission to, or like it’s not my choice to debate their plan (because it is admittedly in my best interest). So I fight like hell, cry if I have to, call a friend, but sit down and eat because letting the eating disorder win is simply just not working for me.That was long but I really really feel this. My heart goes out to you. Be gentle with yourself. Forgive yourself. It’s ok to make mistakes, just figure out what you lacked in that moment, get back on track, and try something new the next time. Keep fighting 💕 
In case you haven’t heard it today, you are doing great. You are important and you are brave and you are enough. 
A huge mocha soft serve because I love ice cream and I hate anorexia :) 
💗 please don’t be mad at your body 💗💗 it’s doing its best 💗 
I had a good recovery day yesterday in that I ate whatever, had more Oreos than I’ve ever had in a day before because I’ve been craving them for months, ordered what I wanted for dinner anyway, AND got ice cream with my (future) sisters-in-law for her birthday and ended up sticking half in the freezer because I was full and wanted to honor my hunger cues. Went to bed not hungry for the first time in months. So of course today I’m in a very bad place, but I’ll make it through.  
I don’t care how many times I have to tell myself I will not relapse. Gotta say it to believe it, I guess. 
One year and 10 lbs heavier, but so much happier and healthier  
I hope that one day we will all be betterone day every ana account will be a recovery account. every preteen and teen will be assured and cared for and protected, lead away from these disorders. We will heal and thrive and we will all get to where we are supposed to be. We will quiet the voice that tells us to starve. One day we will all be better.  
About RecoveryHey! I’m putting myself into recovery. I’ve been eating 800 calories daily this last week and my mood as increased, my love has increased, and my mindset has shifted. I can’t stand idly by and kill myself anymore. I knew I had it in me!! I’m hopeful. Please keep reading if you’re considering recovery./Here’s my story, quickly. I was depressed for all of high school. I missed my prom, I missed all my grades inside jokes, I missed friends and parties and everything. In mid 2018 I started restricting. I think July? I’ve lost a lot of weight. I lived for the next time I’d see people and they’d say hey you look great! But now I dread it. Aren’t I worth more than my weight? Why is the first thing you always say related to my appearance? I started to hate myself more than I ever did with a BMI of 32.2./Let’s not bullshit. Confidence comes with weight loss. But confidence DOES NOT equal self love. I’m gonna repeat that. /Confidence =/= Self Love/People’s priorities and needs are never the same from one’s recovery to the next. A lot of recovery posts say, hey, you deserve to eat! I personally never had the mentality that I didn’t deserve to eat. I’ve never used meanspo and I’ve never encouraged anyone else to be anorexic. My priorities were different. I starved myself because I hated myself, and I figured if I looked a certain way I wouldn’t hate myself anymore. Here’s the scoop, scoob:/Even if I liked the way I looked, I would still hate myself./And literally I don’t have the energy to like ANYTHING right now. Even with 800 calories daily I’m so gone mentally. Let’s say, theoretically, there was a correlation relationship between weight and self-love. My brain would deadass be so gone from lack of nutrition that I wouldn’t even be able to register the idea that I love myself. Please, consider that. Your brain is not working. You are not capable./I’m deleting my blog tomorrow. I want to rip the rug out from under my feet. Please, please consider recovery today. It can be scratchy and rough. It can be upping your intake to 600-2000cal daily. Who cares, it’s yours, and you can increment it however you need to./I hope you grab your love from within you and wear it on your sleeve. I hope you walk to enjoy the view instead of the effect on your body. More than anything, I hope you have the strength to say you’re more than your eating disorder. You aren’t your calories or the lies you’ve told or the food you’ve binged. You’re you, and there’s nothing more individually beautiful than the self./I want to thank @royalveinspaperplanes. Your posts and words influence me greatly. You’re amazing for all you do in the community. You’ve genuinely helped me and I hope you find your way back to recovery. Don’t be afraid to take care of yourself❤❤❤ 
Where I’m at these days. No counting, no weighing, and no dancing—and I think it needs to stay that way for a while. Thanks for the encouragement on my last text post ❤️❤️❤️ 
My eating disorder hasn’t been present in a while and I’m relieved that I can focuse on the things that make me happy. Life is tough and sometimes I want to crawl into bed an give up, but then I think about all of the things I have and will achieve and how beautiful life can be and stand back up. It’s okay to have these feelings, it’s okay to feel like your drowning. It happens. It’s all about picking yourself back up. I am an adult. My eating disorder wanted me to feel helpless and weak. Wanted me to believe that I am a burden. But I am not even though sometimes I feel like I am. I have to keep going and be the best version of myself for myself  
One of the most difficult habits to get rid of in my recovery is the constant checking of calories. I still catch myself doing it sometimes, and I need to fight against it. It just became something so natural to me, I sometimes do it without even thinking, which sucks.However, yesterday I did something I had never done before: I bought something (those frozen vegan hamburgers) and I didn’t feel the need to look at the package and check the calories. This is such a victory for me because usually I either already know the calories to something (which I’m always trying to forget) or I have almost an irresistible urge to check the package.As soon as I got home, I did what I always do (also, here’s a tip for everyone trying recovery, this helps a lot): I took the burgers out of the package and put them in a bag in the freezer. Then, I threw the package away and guess what? I still have no idea how many calories they have.I tried one today and they’re so good! I didn’t feel guilty at all eating them and, in fact, I’m very happy I decided to buy them. 
ALL BODIES ARE SUMMER BODIES 
does anyone else with/recovering from an ED ever find themselves stopping and thinking how weird it is to not eat when they are hungry? (like, I caught myself today thinking I wanted a banana and looking at the clock to see if it was time to eat and wondering if I should change what I had planned to eat and have a banana instead of the apple I was going to have with my other food- it’s so weird to have a zillion rules and overthink all of this instead of just being like, “I am hungry, I want a banana” -> *eats a banana*” 
“You’re more than flesh and bones.”—Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato (in “Fall in Line”)  
A letter to those suffering from an ED:I know that what you are going through is tough. I know you don’t feel at home in your recovered body.⁣ Instead of focusing on how bad you feel, remember the perspectives that help you see your eating disorder will never again be able to help you. ⁣Your reward centre isn’t working as it should - that’s not your fault, but it doesn’t make eating bad, and you need to retrain your brain to recognise reward. Think about how you would feel if another sufferer successfully completed a meal. When you feel reward through something such as movement, remind yourself that that is what it should feel like when you accomplish something.⁣Restricting doesn’t make you a superhuman. It gives you an adrenaline rush that is very short lived, and overall you can get much more done if you live each day at 50%, than one day at 100% and four at 0% as a result. You are not invincible. ⁣You have value even when the things you do are not perfect. Being reliable 75% of the time is better than not being reliable at all. You don’t have to be perfect to have value. ⁣Recognising your own value is so important. Be kind to others, but never at the detriment to yourself. Do not set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You were not put on this earth to fix anyone but yourself.⁣Most importantly, you CAN get through this. I know it seems impossible, I know it feels like eating dinner every day will kill you, I know it seems like you will never love the skin you are in, but I promise you one day these things will not be the most important things in your life. The recovery train will take you to far greater places than your eating disorder could ever dream of.⁣⁣Keep fighting, because your future is so worth fighting for. 
Okay, so I think this is the meanest, most hurtful anon message I have ever received. Honestly, what you said is exactly what my eating disorder tells me every day. It tells me that my meal plan MUST be too high for me to have gained this much weight since I honestly haven’t binged in over a year and a half. But you’re wrong, and my eating disorder is wrong. I know this because the professionals who went to school for years to learn these things told me so. BMI is a totally shit measure of how healthy your weight is. Despite what my eating disorder tells me, I was underweight for me 50 pounds ago. I was, quite literally, dying. And now, I’m at a healthy weight for my body and I’m thriving. My weight restoration and recovery is just as valid as people who had an extremely low BMI and gained to a normal BMI. Because BMI is so incredibly stupid. It does not take into account family history, bone size, muscle mass, growth trends, or any of that.I hope that you get the help that you need, anon. You have some skewed perspectives about what recovery and health looks like. I really, truly hope that you are able to get treatment and are able to love yourself and carry that love over to other people, instead of sending hateful, damaging messages to people you know are in recovery from severe eating disorders. 
Just deleted ALL of my posts with thinspo or anything that could encourage mine or possibly anyone else’s eating disorder. Every time I’ve relapsed, I’ve felt stronger when I choose to recover again. The only reason this last time was so bad was because something happened that really damaged my mental health overall. But I know I can do this no matter what happens 
maybe you didn’t ever actually stop eating. maybe you still ate the same amount of food as before our horrible world corrupted your mind (which is not your fault!). maybe it just feels so painful to take a bite of anything with calories, but you still ate. but you know what? you’re still valid and you still deserve and need to follow the path to recovery. it may be a small thing in your mind right now, but it’s better to treat it now, because it’s gonna grow into a big thing. it may even be a big thing. either way, you shouldn’t have to feel like you’re undeserving of help and recovery just because some people have it worse than you!!ok to reblog 
today I was home, studying, and as soon as everyone went out, meaning I was left alone, my first thought was “HURRY UP! GO BODY CHECK! WEIGH YOURSELF! TAKE SELFIES! THE MIRROR IS ALL YOURS!” and I instantly stood up but stopped myself like “???? what are you doing, boo???? we dont do this anymore??? you can sit back now” and right then and there I realized how much time I used to spend torturing myself every single day. it was a relief to know I didnt have to go body check, that it was a choice and that I am brave enough now to choose not to do that. 
Today I was looking for recipes for food to meal prep next week and thought, I don’t need it to be low calorie, I need it to be food that sustenta me. And if that isn’t the truest thing ever.Food is goodFood is fuelFood is fuelFood is NOT the enemie, your eating disorder is 
Tomorrow, May 30th, marks my five year ED recovery date. I’m always torn between being amazed that I’ve lasted for so long, and have come so far, and the desire to give in and indulge my ED. It’s so hard. And I always feel guilty…I’m constantly fighting to stay afloat in my sea of madness. And when my BPD gets bad, all I want to do is gorge myself on food and life, and purge until my stomach is hollow and caving in. I know that I need to keep it together if I want to do well in grad school, in the fall; if I want to maintain my friendships; if I want to achieve my dreams; if I want to be healthy; and if I want to be in a healthy, romantic relationship. It’s just so hard sometimes. Too often, I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders. I don’t remember the girl I was before my ED, so I’m tasked with creating someone new. I’m slowly creating myself.I want so much. I want to continue creating art and weaving stories; I want to travel the world; I want to be hopelessly infatuated with living; I want to love and be loved; I want to be in love, romantically, and treated with gentleness; I want to learn and explore; I want to eat good food.I want. I want. I want.I am. I am. I am.I’ve finally killed the girl I used to be.  
I am worth recovery even when I feel totally un-worth it 
So here’s the thing. I’m sad. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I am currently facing redundancy at work, have little money and I am extremely single and feel like I have nothing to actually recover for… 
But this girl is still not giving up. 
There are far worse places to be in, and even if an eating disorder tells me there is no point to recovery, then maybe my motivation can be to prove those thoughts wrong. 
I guess this is a bit of a sad post, but I wanted to put it out it out there as I admire so many of these amazing beautiful recovery queen’s who are aceing it and in these wonderful relationships with beautiful houses and interesting careers… But I wanted to remind myself that even though I don’t feel like I have those, and am lost in life at the moment… That doesn’t make me any less worthy of recovery. 
Hence eating this cheesecake without feeling motivation, but knowing I need to challenge myself. 
Today Sucked!!!but i’m still going to eat something, and i’m still going to wash my face and have some nice oatmeal tomorrow morningwe will try again tomorrow. and if tomorrow isn’t better, we will keep trying 💘🍓🤟 
There is NOTHING wrong with being soft. Society has tried to beat into us that everything about us should be hard, from our abs to our hearts. Of course, strength and toughness are good things to have sometimes, but that doesn’t always come naturally to everyone. So, don’t be afraid to be soft.If who you are is soft-spoken, BE THAT.If who you are is emotional and sensitive, BE THAT. If who you are includes a soft tummy, DON’T YOU DARE FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT.All of those traits are beautiful and vital to this world. YOU are vital to this world. Exactly as you are. 
Shaming someone will not make them recover. Telling someone that they are ruining your life won’t make them recover. If you want to help someone recover from an eating disorder, be supportive. And if you don’t know how, ask them how you can best support them through their recovery  
2 MONTHS!! This morning on my walk I’ve been reflecting on life 2 months ago to now. Two months ago I was in the hospital unable to walk, unable to sit without a lot of assistance, my gastrointestinal system was not working and my only stability came from a nasogastric tube with its contents being the thing keeping my body going. Oh what a difference health makes. Then I was scared for my health, today I’m grateful for it. These days I’m eating very regularly, I have more peace and hope and everyday I’m working towards my goals. It’s not a one-time decision but a daily one, and it only happens moment by moment, choice by choice. I’m grateful that my body has made the stable comeback that it has and everyday is an opportunity to look after my body and my health in the best way that I can ❤️ Posting this to remind myself how far I’ve come and why I owe to it myself to live this life in the very best way that I can 🌸 
You’re beautiful ❤️ You deserve love ❤️ You deserve to be happy ❤️ If you need anything, message me ❤️ You’re loved darling ❤️ 
Just your daily reminder to be a strong, badass feminist. ♥️ 
Breakfast.. Feeling guilty now. But I’m gonna keep fighting :) 
Recovery Plan I will start by forcing myself to have a net cal intaje of 700 calories a day, which is terrifying. Once 700 is no longer scary and I am comfortable, I will move up to 800 and then continue adjusting to higher calories until Im at 1200 a day. I will not weigh myself at all. I will continue to exercise, but the more I exercise, the more I have to eat. This is terrifying but I know it will be worth it. Also, @daydreamingofdusk really inspired me to recover. Their blog just radiates comfort and reassurance. I reccomend anyone thinking about recovery to take a look and remember whats good for them. Im so happy to be taking steps in a new direction, away from my eating disorder. I know I can do this.  
If you are recovering or want to recover from an ED, please read this.I’ve seen a lot of people on here who were in their recovery journey, and they ended up developing another eating disorder instead of truely recovering. Please do try and recover. Don’t let this scare you, but don’t forget to consult with a dietician or someone who was successful in their recovery journey or a coach or whatever… Just don’t go into it alone.First thing you need is support. If not from friends and family then from an online following. I know many anas who aren’t in recovery who would cheer you on if you are, myself included. We don’t want you to suffer, we only want to understand eachother and minimise the damage. Please do get help if you can. We want eachother to recover and be safe and happy.Second thing is order. To fight a disorder, you need order. Obviously. You need to regulate your diet. Best way to do this is to get a doctor involved. If you can’t, then someone with experience. Since you already have an ED you are prone to getting another one, it’s just how it is. So you have to prevent that from happening. It’s really easy to develop a BED while you are in recovery, or become obsessed with fitness etc… If you are still looking to lose weight while you are in recovery (because you are overweight and are afraid it would cause complications etc) please try to do so in a healthy way. If you are looking to gain it (because you are underweight) try to not do so by binging it back up, and so on. Best way to do so is by having a professional monitor your eating habits to prevent irregularities.Third thing is you need to prevent relapses. Surround yourself with positivity. Don’t let the voices tell you how you look. Listen to compliments, talk to someone about your worries. Recognise the signs of a relapse and stop it right where it is. It will not control you anymore. You are the one who controls it. Focus on your own happiness and not the ED’s happiness.And now with that in mind, good luck on your journey. 
Just Keep Breathing; for me it’s a reminder to keep going despite my depression, despite the anxiety, despite any eating disorder urges I have. It’s a reminder to slow down, because everything is going to be okay. 
Eating is hard. Recovery is hard. I’m trying to force myself to eat an appropriate amount every day, but eating anything at all still feels like too much. I wish I could just snap my fingers and have my eating disorder be gone for good 
I will never be as skinny, but I will be free.  
I haven’t purged or starved for at least a week. I’m so thankful my lovely boyfriend is being so supportive and motivating me to be healthy.  Even my mom said to me yesterday “wow your skin has color.  You don’t look so gray anymore. ”This is hard for me to not calorie count or purge or restrict but when my bf or my mom tells me how happy they are and proud they are of me for eating it makes it a little easier.  
“There is far too much out there to waste days, months, or even years trapped in the limbo state of being well enough to survive, but sick enough to be miserable.” -fighting.for.progress on Instagram—I relate to this so hard. And right now I feel myself slipping back into this limbo state. I’m sort of losing sight of recovery. I don’t know if I want it anymore; I feel too tired and distracted to even care.Today I restricted breakfast and I just felt relief. I don’t have time to be sad, anxious, or numb. With work and now returning back to school after 4 years, leaving before starting my sophomore year, I need to be focused, I need to be strong. And I guess recovery is like on the back burner. I have to be strong to fight these urges but I need to be strong in other areas of my life right now and that’s where I’m putting all of my energy.When I wasn’t in school and was working part time, recovery was my job. Now I am adding other things on my plate. And before, restricting used to be hard because I was so strong in my recovery. Now it’s easier, and that scares me.I know what I can lose if I go down this road again. But I miss the feeling of being empty. Like when I restrict I get that immediate relief and then I snap back into working hard and planning things out for school in the fall. Then I come home and feel drained, so I sit with the urge to restrict because everyone is home so I have to eat.Today I got “lucky” because no one was around for breakfast so I got away with restricting.And then lunch is hard because I eat with co-workers and I’m too tired to come up with excuses to skip lunch or to find a hiding place where I can leave for 30mins and come back and say I ate lunch.I guess that’s a good thing that there are barriers to my restricting meals. Let’s hope it stays that way… 
This is just a post to document that this morning I woke up with hope again, and faith and expectancy for the future. This week I’ve felt pretty overcome and overwhelmed by all this, but today I know I will move forward and that hope is absolutely real and I can have a beautiful future 💖🌸 
HI HERE IS ME RE-COMMITTING TO RECOVERY AFTER MY LAST RELAPSE!!! Wanted to share this successful day with you all, let’s get back up and fight to get our lives back! ♡ 
Yesterday’s snacks.. It was a lot but I told myself to relax and just let myself have some sweets ‘n stuff :)  
I WILL GET CURRY INSTEAD OF EATING A MOTHER EFFIN SALAD NOW AND ILL EAT NAAN WITH IT AND MAYBE ILL EAT ICE CREAM AS DESSERT BC HOLY FUCK I AM ALLOWED TO EAT 
im sick of this shit i want to recover  
Because I CAN trust my brain. It’s an eating disorder I can’t trust!  I can treat myself to yummy treats, and nights in doing nothing. I am allowed that. I will graduate with a degree. And I will recover.    
So I deleted my calorie counting app and downloaded this ed recovery app and omg it’s calling me out at every turn The app is called Rise Up 
Don’t listen to that monster in the back of your brain when it tells you that you don’t deserve to be happy.Because you do. You really do.So allow yourself to feel happy when good things happen to you, and tell that monster in your head to fuck off. 
I feel that I’ve been on the verge of relapse lately. The mirror checking, the constant thoughts about what and how much I’ve eaten, the ‘I’m not trying to lose weight, but I gotta watch my body’… I don’t even know where those thoughts are coming from, I’m happy, life is good!!Right now I shudder even thinking about restricting, thank God.But still, I need to be very, very careful and gentle towards myself.I. NEITHER. WANT. NOR. NEED. YOU. ANA!!  
I checked the scale again, (I know I shouldn’t have), and I’ve gained a bit of weight which I know mostly has to be water weight but it still stresses me out extremely. My mind is telling me to not eat tomorrow or wait until later when I’m at work so I’ll only eat once, but I wont do that. I need to do better, and I cant let this ruin the progress I’ve been making. I use the thought that I need to be better for my boyfriend a lot, but I also just need to be better for myself. Itll be hard, but I’ll keep going 🖤 
Just an update to say that I’m feeling the most well I’ve felt in a number of weeks. I feel healthy and I’m really really grateful for that. I’m finally medically stable and will be making the move to the mental health ward probably today or tomorrow. Really not looking to facing solid food again, but being as mindful as I can and grateful for all of the small things in front of me and all the people doing this journey with me 💜 The best is yet to come 
Recovery is terrifying (please read)Hey everyone! I haven’t posted in awhile because I’ve sorta been recovering. I’ve been eating whatever I went but I know it’s still under 1,000 calories each day. If I eat even two meals, my stomach hurts so so badly. That’s because your stomach is a muscle and I haven’t used this muscle in ahwile. That’s how eating 100 calories every day for a few months will effect you. This is scary and I don’t know if I’ll stick with it but I’m so happy. I can eat anything! The best part is that I’m maintaining my weight. Please guys, eat more, be free. You can eat more and maintain your weight. It feels so good! 
Anyway, before we can consider veganism, vegetarianism, anything-ism, or even whether a food is healthy or not, we have to feed ourselves. I repeat you have to make sure you’re consistently feeding yourself before you attempt to change your diet. Skipping food/restricting is always less healthy than eating. Yes if it’s a twinkie. You have to eat! Yes, even if that means you need to eat meat. Yes, even if you need to eat McDonald’s. You. Need. To. EAT.If you can’t feed yourself consistently, you can’t make more restricting choices about your diet without it harming you. Just eat.  
Just realized I love my face. Huh. 
There’s only one you, and that you is wonderful. If you weren’t here, the world would be missing out on something truly special ❤ 
I’m gonna win this fight 
you are worth it. 
This marks the first time I’ve worn shorts outside of my house in over two years! With the anxiety came the feeling of accomplishment, and this is a big step forward for me in accepting myself. 
Things are really hard and I’m struggling to cope in these 4 walls. BUT I do not want this to be my life. I do not want to continue to cycle in and out of hospital. I do not want to continue to live on continuous feeds because I feel incapable of facing food again. I want to live my life. I want to hold onto hope and find life and joy again. I want to walk in fresh air and go back to school and finish my degrees and spend time with my friends. There is so much more to life than this eating disorder and I refuse to let it steal the rest of my life from me. 
I ate way too little yesterday and I just couldn’t let my ED voice in my head win so I thought about it for like over an hour and then decided to just do it and buy myself really good ice cream. At first I thought I can not finish it after a few scoops and I put it back in the freezer but then after a few hours my stomach felt better and I could eat the whole pint. With the ice cream I had about  2300 calories in total then and I didn’t let Ana control my life that day :)  
Honestly I hate how girls and women are encouraged to just lose weight, to take up less space, to be weak or even sick. If you want to change your body you are supposed to restrict your food and maybe do some cardio. Fuck diets and fuck relying only on cardio! Bodyweight training, weight lifting, yoga, THOSE will get you the fastest results if you are consistent. When you restrict your body eats away at itself and you become sick and weak. When you nourish your body and build muscle those muscles will continue to burn fat for you even when you are at rest. I was taught to fall in love with watching my already thin body shrinking in on itself, I wanted to be a weak, sick, wilted flower. But now I just focus on eating mostly whole foods, colourful veggie and fruit filled dishes, and giving my body what it wants when it wants it. Now I’m in love with watching my arms swell and feeling my stomach harden. I’ve known this since I was a child in gymnastics but my body wants to build muscle, it’s always been willing to do that for me. The women on my mom’s side have always been prone to having muscular arms and I don’t care who calls them manly I love my arms and I love that they allow me to do a lot of things people wouldn’t expect me to be able to do given my size.  Women need to be told that it’s okay to build muscle, it feels amazing getting stronger instead of weaker. We were BUILT to climb and lift and move, we were designed to enjoy food. I eat way more now than I did when I was in my disordered eating phase and I’ve gained weight but it’s all muscle. All of my clothes still fit perfectly after the weight gain because I’m the same size just more toned. Gaining weight when you need to doesn’t have to be scary. My body looks better and performs better in daily life than it ever did when I was strict with my diet, and I don’t have as much fatigue slowing me down. Even after I got past my disordered eating I was prone to losing my appetite due to depression so I kept slipping back underweight without realizing and I still felt out of control. Having larger muscles to maintain means that I am far less likely to lose my appetite and I am more likely to want to eat even if I don’t feel like it because I like my muscles and I want to nourish them instead of leaving my body to eat away at them in desperation. It’s okay to have visible muscle tone, it’s okay to take up space, it’s okay to give your body the sustenance it needs to be healthy. Your body wants to get stronger to make your daily life easier. Your body is not your enemy .  
I AM GOING TO RECOVER ITS GOING TO BE LONG AND HARD BUT I WILL, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS EVER HAPPENS TO ME 
Im going into recovery.. I think.. at least I'gonna try. I told my parents about everything and their reaction was better than I expected. They are very supportive. Im getting out it this dark place that Ive been in for two years. Im ready to live again. I hope the best for you all. Truly.

Things you can enjoy if you recover:-fast food-friends-parties-family dinners-traveling -sex-Christmas -birthdays-exercise -sleeping in-clubbing-cold weather -buying clothes -relationships-baking -your mom’s cooking -health-life Things you can enjoy if you keep your eating disorder:-a false sense of control-momentary euphoria after seeing the number in the scale drop-momentary relief after a purge  
having body fat is human and shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of or insecure about ❤️ 
Thank you to everyone for all the kind messages, you’re all making recovery that much easier  
This feels like it should be so obvious, but I see bona fide recovery bloggers who are guilty of this attitude. Making compromises with your ED is not recovery. It can be a first step forward, but if you consider yourself to be out of the woods in terms of recovery, talk about “rarely” dealing with disordered thoughts, but are still only holding off on disordered behaviors because you want to be “slim thick,” “slim and strong!” or other codes for “skinny but, like, in a way I consider healthy,” your disorder still has a foothold. Many of us who’ve lost a significant amount of weight due to our disorder will gain it all back. Some will gain even more. This is literally healthy. Recovery from restrictive EDs always involves some gaining because your body is going to hoard nutrients when you first start properly feeding it. Even for those recovering from binge eating disorders, letting go of the obsession with weight and size is an important part of moving past the feelings which create the urge to binge.TL;DR: The urge to control the path of your recovery will always get in your way. Recovery isn’t a new form of control, it’s embracing your body without feeling the need to control it. It is exercising because it feels good, eating because it tastes good, living in the moment, and trusting your body. Not trusting it to stay skinny. Trusting it to do its job of helping you live. 
I’m also talking to my body a lot. She tells me a lot of confusing things, but that’s because I don’t speak her language anymore. But we’re talking. 
She loves me, and I want to love her. And I’m trying.  
Where I’ve been Early 2019: Grunge, dark aesthetic, drinking too much, drugs, hardcore relapse, sad, lethargic, jaded, hot headed, not taking care of myself, no check on mental health, brooding. Where I’m trying to be for the rest of 2019: flowy sun dresses, light aesthetic, soft, optimistic, happy thoughts, battling my depression and anxiety and staying strong, slowly recovering from my eating disorder, doing my best for my mental health, being energetic, smiling through it all, letting myself feel for a while and then moving on and pucking myself up.I’m really going to recover and do my best to be positive and confident and all of you are welcome to watch! If you post thinspo or anything triggering, you can still follow me but I wont be following back. If you post recovery things, I will be following back. I am going to bloom and it will be beautiful 
today I had the chance to skip lunch but stopped studying, went out to buy some groceries then proceeded to cook me a nutritious & delicious meal because a) I was hungry and b) need food regardless so!! I even got dessert so who’s winning♥  
When the morning sadness stretches over my room, I long to find words that describe where my mind is taking me. My cup of tea is always half empty and I keep reminding myself that I need to put the kettle on the stove again. Poetry is beautiful until your fingers start bleeding because you’ve been writing nonsense for hours. I look back on a different life survived last year by a girl who was too afraid to live. I don’t wish for that numbness anymore. I don’t wish for the world to be afraid of me because the silence between us would be unbearable. They have let me down before but I haven’t been the best version of me either. When I stir  my coffee tomorrow morning, I’ll realize I was brave enough to add milk this time. Maybe I don’t need poetry to prove I am all about ups and downs. I am living proof. the recovery stories. (V.B) 
tw ednow when I see pictures of how I looked when I deprived myself from so much, it just pains me. I did not realize I looked miserably unhealthy. I’m so glad I recovered and I never think about doing horrible things to myself again. I overcame that.  
Taking recovery seriously tonight. The 8 keys to recovery from an eating disorder workbook is new and just picked it up tonight :)  
ReflectionSo I have just finished my first year of college. Currently, I’m struggling a little bit, but I wanted to take some time to reflect on how far I really have come. 2 years ago, I didn’t think I’d make it. I was so wrapped up in my ED that it was all I cared about. And then the summer of 2017 changed my life when I went inpatient. I started my senior year of high school just a few days after I got home from treatment. But that school year was different from all my others. I had a voice I never knew I had. I made friends and got an amazing boyfriend. Then college came. Some days were rough, but to be honest, I love my school. I have earned opportunities I would have never imagined for myself, and I feel like a part of the community for once. Next semester I will start my job as a Resident Assistant, something I’m super excited for. I have many more things planned as well. So maybe I’m struggling a little right now, but I have overcome so much, and I truly cant wait to see what the future holds. Recovery is worth it. 
Second- every person living with an eating disorder has real emotions, real lives, real heartbreaking moments in their past, and real goals that they are trying to achieve. Every human is valid and worthy of love and support. Each and every one of us. Leave the hate behind. If you can’t say something nice- get out. 
recovery from an ED is baby stepsMore words from my therapist!! For all of you wanting a way out of, or help starting recovery from an ED(anorexia in this case)This is kind of a short one, a single-tip post, but important nonetheless!!Recovery isn’t immediate. You don’t start eating or stop feeling urging to restrict just magically. Even if you aren’t currently restricting due to lapses and relapses and the way those work; you can’t magically stop relapsing either.So here’s what my therapist gave me about that: When you feel an urge to restrict or a relapse coming back, obviously it is ideal you fight the relapse and don’t restrict. But since it can often be inevitable, try upping your restrictions just a little every time. Restricting 300? Try 500. Next time you relapse, now that you’ve gotten cozy at 500? Do 600 or 700. Even if it takes a few months or even a year, your ‘restricting’ can be reduced to 1000 calories. Then from there, or even during this process, you can work on other things, as this is just one facet method of recovery out of the whole process.I myseld don’t plan to recover soon, but for those who do or are, this one is for y’all!! <33 
i feel terrible bc ive been in recovery from an eating disorder for about 9 years and i’m still suffering permanent health consequences and its my fault and would have been 100% prevented if didnt go through that as a teen  
went to veg fest today! it’s crazy to think how much easier it is for me to eat food now than it was just a few months ago. i feel proud of myself for how far i’ve come, im leagues healthier now than i was this time last year. it’s kind of crazy 
Th*nspo blogs are following me which is really upsetting, but it y’all want to see my blog and my posts get ready to see some real body positivity. Ed recovery is worth it. 
body positivity time babeyI just looked in a mirror for a solid minute without feeling self hatred!!I came at the whole thing with an attitude I had heard of: “if I were to see another woman who looked exactly like me, would I think these things about her?” of course not. and I didn’t!!!!! I had to kind of step out of myself for a bit to do it, but this is actually a huge goal for me :)))))  
baby steps…. and baby leaps… and baby jumpsMission accomplished: stop the downward spiral. I’ve decided recovery is kind of like being a superhero or a spy (which I’ve decided is a nerdy/tech version of a superhero). Hear me out: all of these new coping mechanisms are kind of like spy gear. Especially initially, they work really well. Eventually, I will need more tools, more help, more support, but for now I am celebrating the fact that ‘hey I tried something’ and ‘hey it actually worked?!’ Small changes in my journaling helped me process my thoughts and make the biggest leaps  *10 full notebook sheets later* What exactly did I do? 1st. Working TREMENDOUSLY to separate the Ed-voice and Ed-self from my Healthy-voice and Healthy-self. This took some time. I have struggled with this for possibly years and remained stuck, unable to identify any real “healthy self” outside of running. 2nd. Journal the exact event or scenario triggering me. 3rd. Identify the ED-voice and it’s response to said scenario. 4th. Identify the healthy-voice and challenge the ED-voice. 5th. Identify a healthy alternative to said scenario.6th. Enact the healthy alternative. Now, this is 90% of my journaling. Identifying the thought, challenging it, offering a better alternative. VOILAA 
Stop listening to your ED thoughts and posting them on the fucking internet. That’s not “venting”, that’s dwelling. That’s giving power to your disordered thoughts. It’s not helping anyone. You should be challenging those thoughts and replacing them with productive ones. Don’t let your ED thoughts win and do NOT share them online to bring other people down. 
I will tell myself that life is beautiful until I believe it  
Fun recovery fact guys:When you eat more you actually have energy ?? My friends have said that I’ve been so much more bubbly and fun to be around now that I actually have energy to be more than an ana-consumed blob  
i know that exam times are hard for me…and for everyone else who struggles with mental illness…the addition of academic stress (especially for a perfectionist) is NOT helpful to the recovery process. so for anyone who is struggling right now and feels alone, I AM HERE FOR YOU. please PLEASE message me if you need or want to talk to someone who is also in that boat. i would love to talk to you! <3 truly. it could be good for the both of us :) 
Definitely one of the most difficult aspects of anorexia recovery. Currently feeling (and looking) like I’m 5 months pregnant, but I’m determined to keep feeding this body that has been with me through so much  
I wish I had a friend who understood what it was like growing up with an eating disorder and how it’s still affecting me to this day. I’m struggling so much with my body image rn and I could just use someone to lean on who won’t judge me for the thoughts I keep having. (Recovery talk only, I’m not interested in glorifying illness).  
now that i’m recovered from anorexia i’m like what was the point of having an eating disorder in the first place if i’m gonna gain all the weight back and more in order to recover lol just dont ever restrict bros go to therapy 
It’s Mental Health Awareness Month and it’s one of those days where I need to feel motivated to continue my recovery process. It’s the first time I am posting pictures where the before and after is the opposite of what I would have posted two years ago.
One year between the two pictures but you can tell which one is happier, healthier, full of glow and love, and recovered from the deadly anorexia that consumed me and robbed me of life.
To anyone recovering, it is worth it. The thing I am most happy about since recovering is the ability to love tenderly, something I had forgotten was possible. I am so grateful I can love. 
RecoveryJust deleted the post with the most notes on my whole blog, because it was thinspo and eating disorder related and I wanna fully commit to recovery If you were following me for ed-motivation-purpose, then feel free to unfollow. I wanna promote healthy living and will share my journey of starting to accept myself, dealing with studies and conquering my mental disorders.Please be kind 
‘Frail’It’s a word I’ve just seen to describe someone my age with anorexia. I haven’t been described as that, but is that a word I want to be associated with? Frailty is something I associate with grandparents, heck, not my grandparents but great-grandparents. With people with bone conditions, elderly people who’ve lived wholesome lives and have their families around them to care for them.Not someone who is 24.Not someone who had never stepped in a doctors (aside from skin conditions) before anorexia.Strong, is what I’d like to be described as. Happy, is another. Carefree. Smiley. Full of life. Glowing. Bright. Courageous. Joyous. Fun. Headstrong.Those are words I would much rather be associated with.Not frail. Not weak. Not struggling. Not stagnant. Not ill. 
The day that I accept my wide bone structure is the day I truly recover.Will that ever happen? Stay tuned :“)) 
I’m such a snack today 😘 
I wish I could tell my younger self that all of the things that my eating disorder promised me were all lies and that it was only through recovery that I actually got all of them 
Weight Restoration To all of you recovering from an eating disorder out there that are at a “healthy weight” or are weight restored and are still struggling, I see you. This stuff’s hard, and I personally think it’s even harder to accept yourself after weight restoration. Keep on going everybody. I’m proud of you. If you ever want to talk, I’m here for you. 
Today is a new day. Recommitting to recovery today.  
To myself:I want to make a commitment to you.I have spent almost a decade now trying to prove I love you. Fighting my brain as it spews out reasons I shouldn’t. Trying to eat and keep it down. Trying to keep the lit cigarettes and razors away from your skin. Trying to reassure you that the touch on your flesh of those you didn’t want does not define you and isn’t your fault. I have promised a million times that I will take better care of you and put you first, that I will value you and listen to you, that I will keep you safe, that I will love you.And I have failed. I can’t begin to count all the ways that I failed. I spend my days begging for people to love me. I waste hours on dating apps, and I let people treat you wrong. I let people sexualize you even when it makes your skin crawl. I let people lie to you. And use you. And manipulate you. I don’t stand up to them. I don’t stand up for you.I spend all my time on other people, desperate for them to distract me from you. I don’t want to hear about what hurts your heart. I don’t listen to how you need to heal. I keep you at bay. I ignore your needs. I neglect you.I stare at your reflection in the mirror, poking at the places that are too big, sucking in, pulling skin. You are never good enough for me. Even when you were skin and bones you were still not good enough. I treat you as half a person. I tell you that you are broken as long as you’re alone, that you need someone to fix you. I spend all my energy looking for that someone. Instead of spending it on you.I want to change that. I want to make a commitment to you.I deleted all of the dating apps today because I want to focus on you now. I want to listen to you when you feel unsafe. I want to listen to you when your heart hurts. You are not half a person. You are whole. I will treat you as a whole. You do not need someone to fix you. You just need to be loved. By me.I will love you. I want to keep my promises. Please let me try again.I will love you. 
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨ 
felt really really good in my recovery for a hot second, all of a sudden I feel huge and disgusting OBVIOUSLY after a bad day… it’s so obvious that this sickness manifests itself from deeper issues than hating your body. I guess it’s good now that I can recognize that. I will not relapse, not now, not ever. 
If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
Lovelies 💕❤️🐥The “deserves to love and nourish themselves” is stored in the you ❤️💕 
You deserve love. You deserve good energy. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you. You deserve to love who you are. You deserve to be at peace. 
Listen to me You are allowed to eat. You are allowed to drink.You are allowed to rest.You are allowed to take a break.You are allowed to treat yourself.You are allowed to say no.You are allowed to put yourself first 
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
things to remember:- there is nothing shameful about being hungry (even when your mind tells you you “shouldn’t” be)- there is nothing shameful about listening to your body (even if it feels like you are doing something wrong)- do not compare what your body needs to what other people are eating, they are not you - you always have permission to eat more 
You are allowed to feel sadness without taking it out on your body.You are allowed to feel guilt without attacking yourself.You are allowed to feel insecure without taking compensatory measures.You are allowed to feel.You are allowed.  
when your life means more than the size of your body I promise your whole world is going to change 
Your eating disorder will never willingly let you go. It’s never going to say to you one day, “Okay that was fun while it lasted. I’m done here!!” It just wont. You are its oxygen, the fuel to its fire, its home. It feeds off of your self-destruction, your vulnerability, your logical self. You could be seconds from dropping dead and it will still tell you, you are not sick enough. It’s not a diet, a fad, or a trial period. It’s a life-threatening mental illness with one intention: to kill you. Believe me, you are sick enough. But you are also strong enough to beat it. 
If you’re reading this, this is a gentle reminder that you are enough – as is, right now.  
The middle of recovery is awful. It does not feel good. There are moments where it will be clear why you are doing this, ones that will take your breath away. But a majority of the time you will question everything, your thoughts will be racing so much that you will feel like you can’t breathe. You will spend countless days wondering why things can’t be quiet, wondering why you are bothering to work so hard when not fighting would be effortless. Recovery does not feel good. If you are looking around you and are ashamed because you are not in love with this process, please, listen to me. Take a deep breath- It’s okay. It’s okay to hate it. It’s okay to say it sucks. It’s okay to want to give up, to struggle immensely, to be angry, to be uncomfortable (you should be!). and it’s okay to not understand why your smile still feels empty when your stomach is full again. Recovery does not feel good. For goodness sake, I hate it!!! Do not mistake my positivity for perfection. I am not walking through this fire gracefully. I burn and fall and become ashes. And every morning I rise and face the flames over and over again. So please, do not beat yourself up if you are feeling like a failure for not being happy and perfect. Healing is not linear. And you are still brave.  
What aboutWhat about when recovery isn’t smoothie bowls and organic vegan bars and protein cookies? What about when recovery is about trying to eat whatever’s in the fridge because you can’t afford all that? What about when recovery isn’t supportive family members visiting you in hospital and crying with you? What about when recovery is accepting that just because they blame you, it doesn’t mean it’s your fault? What about when recovery isn’t collapsing and being rushed to hospital to be tube fed? What about when recovery is functioning on the outside and learning to deal with ‘you don’t look ill’?You are the one who is ill. You are the one who is recovering. It does not have to look the same as someone else.  
don’t let the complexity of life drive you back to the simplicity of being ill  
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
get rid of the idea that recovery = fat recovery is energy to engage in what makes your heart sing recovery is better skin and stronger hairrecovery is taking opportunities head on recovery is being able to feel warm again recovery is the ability to sleep through the night recovery is being able to concentrate enough to read your favourite novel or sit through your favourite film recovery is birthday cake recovery is having the freedom to live life in colour rather than by a number in your head  
Fun fact: restricting does not solve your problems 
How I started It started as a diet, because I wanted a “bikini body ”.It started as a coping mechanism, to cope with my depression. It started as a way of expressing outwardly my inner pain my parents chose to ignore. It started when my dad pinched my stomach fat and laughed. It started as an obsession, to be perfect in every way. It started as a way of killing myself, without the immediate effect of dying .It started as a way of self harm ,but without the permanent scars. It started as a punishment for my parents’ abusive behaviour. It started as a result of another illness. It started when I couldn’t afford food anymore. It started when my anorexic friends pushed me to be like them. It started after I was sexually abused.It started because I wanted her to stay. It started because I lost appetite and pleasure for anything I used to enjoy.It started when I wanted to be a model. It started when I came across a proana site. It started after I stopped feeling lonely. It started when I began chemotherapy. It started when the skinny girls in my class began to attract those senior guys.It started because I wanted to fit in those size XS jeans again. It started because my mother started too. It started because it was a cry for help. It started, because I have it in my genes. It started because I believed skinny girls to be happier. It started because I wasn’t sick enough. It started because I have OCD. it started because of my gender dysphoria. It started when I couldn’t cope with his death any longer. It started because my doctor called me fat. It started because I wanted to lose weight fast.It started because no other diet seemed to work.It started when living was terribly painful and didn’t want to live any longer. It started when I was ashamed of myself just for existing and breathing made me feel guilty enough, to the point where I couldn’t stop thinking about suicide. I just wanted to disappear and scare everyone away. I started as a result of another ed. Every reason is bad enough for you to recover and you’ll always deserve to be helped, to be loved and to me validated :)Your struggles matter.  
you’re beautiful you’re loved you’re needed you’re alive for a reason you’re stronger than you think you’re gonna get through this i’m glad you’re alive don’t give up 
Recovery feels strange because for so long you got used to the loudness. The presence of the intense pain was almost something you could rely on to be there when everything else was so uncertain. The pain was in itself a coping mechanism. Do this so you don’t have to deal with that. Everyone always says it gets better. But the truth is sometimes your situation doesn’t change, you do. And so when the pain begins to ease there’s a quiet that is so difficult to become accustomed to. And yet you know this is what you need, it is what you must try and fall in love with to replace your mind’s attraction to destruction. You must come round to the fact that life is at times mind numbingly boring, it is at times exhilarating and yet you must keep faith that one day life will be more appealing than illness. 
Eating is 100% okay. We need to eat to live. We need calories for energy. And sometimes, eating makes us happy. So eat today. Eat for you!🌈💞💟 
The hardest thing to hear when you’re weight restored from an eating disorder is, “oh, so you’re cured now?”It always fills us with an odd feeling. The feeling that our emotions and thoughts are no longer valid as we are no longer underweight. But, I just wanted to remind you that:You can still have an eating disorder if you’re at a healthy weight or if you are overweight.Your thoughts are valid.It is okay to express how you are feeling.You are such a wonderful person, who has fought so damn hard to get to where you are now, don’t let any comments take that away from you. 
you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body  
I’m sick of veganism + routine workouts being the common standard for ed recovery. if my recovery means lying in bed eating sweets and chips and “bad foods” (which they are not), then that’s my recovery. it’s not unhealthy compared to the vegans and vegetarians and athletes, it’s healthy because it’s what I find works best for me. end of story 
since it’s national eating disorder awareness week, here’s a picture of me that’s pretty recent. i may not be super toned or have abs anymore like i did at this time last year, but i’m also not eating less than 1200 calories a day and overexercising like i was last year. this is me. this is my body. it’s healthy. last year when i looked “fit”, i wasn’t. my body was so malnourished that after i got home from college i didn’t even have the energy to get out of bed anymore, let alone work out. i was 110 lbs and still thought i was fat. i wasn’t even able to get my period for several months because i wasn’t feeding and treating my body properly. so this is me, healthy. how much do i weigh? i have no idea, and i don’t care. i’m happy with my body and my stomach (which was the place i used to hate the most on my body) but my stomach is cute and it’s rolls when i sit down are cute and i don’t care if i don’t fit into society’s rules of “skinny” or whatever. i’m healthy, and that’s good enough for me 
I saw a tumblr post talking about how there’s no stupid reason not to act on suicidal urges, and I realized that the same is true for ED recovery.There is no dumb reason not to act on behaviors.JUST cleaned the bathroom and don’t want to get it gross again? Perfect.Can’t go running because all your shorts are in the laundry? Awesome.Have to eat lunch because you’re out with a friend and don’t want to be awkward? Fantastic.“Fine I’ll follow this dumb meal plan but only because I don’t have the time to go back into residential”? Beautiful.If it’s the small stuff that keeps you from lapsing, so what? You don’t have to love your body and be completely urge-free to still actively work recovery.One day your reasoning might look like “I’m doing this for my family” or “I’m doing this so I can keep my job,” and eventually there could even come a time when you can say “I’m doing this for me, because I deserve better.”Even if you don’t get there right away, those thoughts that might feel like dumb excuses can keep saving your life until you can. 
friendly reminder that you’re never going to look back on your life when you’re 80 years old and wish you had spent more time counting calories and less time living  
EAT WHAT YOU WANT, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT, KISS WHO YOU WANT 
Becoming less of yourself will not heal the parts of you that hurt 
That food is simply a conglomeration of energy and nutrients that help power your cells which keep you breathing and thinking and movingThat calories have no moral valueThat weight is an arbitrary measure of your relationship to Earth’s gravitational pull and in the scope of the universe the difference between Earth’s gravitational pull on any given human compared to any other human is infinitesimally insignificantThat the mirror will lie to youThat you are not a bad person for taking care of yourself or nourishing yourself or addressing your needs or taking up space 
I feel guilt, but I am not guiltyI feel disgust, but I am not disgustingI feel regret, but I have no reason to be regretful I feel anxiety, but I do not need to be anxious - Tabitha Farrar, from Rehabilitate, Rewire, Recover! Anorexia recovery for the determined adult  
Your eating disorder is a terrible translator. ‘I’m a size 10′ is translated into ‘I’m worth less than those who are a size 8 or 6 and should be a size smaller’; this is wrong. What it really mean is ‘I’m a size 10.’‘I ate pizza’ quickly becomes ‘I’ve eaten 735 calories of carbs and fats and I need to exercise and purge and fast tomorrow’; once again, ‘I ate pizza’ simply means ‘I ate pizza’. ‘I gained weight’ seems to mean ‘I am lazy and should be ashamed of myself, I am fat and a fake’; the reality is, it just means ‘I gained weight’.‘My BMI is healthy’ turns into ‘I don’t have an eating disorder and need to lose weight to prove I’m sick’; as you can guess, this phrase still only means ‘My BMI is healthy’.Don’t listen to these shitty translations because they are wrong. The phrases don’t need to be translated, they are factual and mean nothing more than they appear to. 
One day you’re going to fight off the urge to relapse and it will be the last time you ever have to again, because you will be recovered.And I think that’s worth fighting for. 
There is joy in just being 
Happy ThanksgivingYou are allowed to enjoy your food, to eat according to your preferences, to eat to the point of satisfactionYou deserve to enjoy this holiday, however that may look to you (NOT to your ED, or judgmental/unkind relatives)You can eat thanksgiving dinner AND eat breakfast and lunch and snacksYou can eat thanksgiving dinner AND all your meals AND not compensate for it before/after the holidayIt is also okay to struggle with this day and have negative emotions….remember you’re not alone in that. We’re all in this together.If the people around you make harmful comments about food/dieting/eating/anything tbh….It is not meant for you. It does not apply to you. Imagine you’re in a bubble/force field/etc and let those comments bounce right off. You have overcome so much and are so strong and you can get through these painful moments.I’m thankful for all of my followers and for everyone who is here, reading this, despite the difficult battles they are fighting. I’m thankful that you continue to fight <3 
YOU DON’T NEED AN EXCUSE TO EAT 
shame.shame is powerful. as an affective neuroscience researcher, i have studied it intensely. unlike many emotions, we are not born with it. shame is taught.i have felt shame over and over in my life. almost all of it has been shame about who i am - a nerd, an athlete, someone who loves reading books more than going to parties, a teacher, a mental health advocate. and it’s time for me to be honest.my eating disorder taught me to be ashamed over food. it taught me that there is shame in eating the foods i love - bread, cupcakes, pasta, peanut butter. it taught me there is shame in eating as much as i want - where a bagel is not a meal, but a snack for me. that i often eat more than 6 times a day. that i love processed foods just as much as any other food, that even though i’m a runner, i don’t want to be constantly focused on what is nutrient-dense and what isn’t.  that i love appetizers and eating the whole meal after, that an english muffin with jam would never hold me over in a million years.this shame has kept me trapped. it has kept me from honoring my body, from fully recovering, from honoring myself. and i’m done. i am so done. i don’t want to be ashamed anymore. it’s time for me to embrace not just food freedom, but total freedom in being myself. and i’ll probably gain weight. i might gain a lot of weight. i might gain only a little. but i’m losing the shame.so here’s to food, all food, to my body, to myself, and expect me to be posting a lot more pictures with all sorts of food because it’s time for me to be proud.  
we will all be okay 
i just really hope that the impact I have on this world is so positive and kind that nobody will have any idea about what I’ve been through. i want that to be my life. To create unparalleled warmth despite the amount of times this world tried to harden my heart and steal my smile 
you know what!!!! i wasn’t born to be skinny!!!!! my body wasn’t meant to be skinny!!!! and that doesn’t mean my body isn’t beautiful!!!!!  
That false sense of accomplishment when you’re underweight due to anorexia will never compare  to the feelings of comfort, safety, and fulfillment when you’ve recovered and can finally fall asleep at night knowing you’ve nourished your body to the best of your ability and given yourself the most love you possibly could. 
their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  
Things that define me:My passions My interests My hobbies My courage My dreams My attitude Things that DON’T define me:My face My body My weight My height The amount of food I ate today 
stop listening to serving sizes and start listening to your body  
Recovery. Is. Not. Linear. Just a friendly reminder that it is okay to take one step forward and two steps back. Be kind to yourself - your mind and body will thank you. 
You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 
You deserve to travel to another country you’ve always dreamed of visiting. To walk the streets, sipping on a pleasant drink unfamiliar to someone of your culture. To stop for a mid morning and afternoon snack, not because you’re necessarily hungry, but because you see a fantastic baked good in the café window that would bring a smile to your face and please your tourist body and mind. You deserve to sit down for a reservation at a restaurant that appears at the top of the list of best places to eat in that country. To start the meal with a thick slice of their locally baked bread with a slab of butter on top. To order a local favorite you’ve never tried before. To drizzle an unusual but intriguing sauce on top that the waiter swears is to die for. To have the waiter persuade you into taking a local favorite dessert back to your hotel room. To sit in the hotel loveseat facing the window view and eat it slowly, taking in the city. You deserve to travel without an eating disorder. You deserve to live without an eating disorder, and experience every joy life has to offer.  
I’m done denying myself life and happiness because of trying to be something I’m not. I’m a broad-shouldered, big hands and feet northern woman with a big bone-frame, and I’m finally proud to say that… that it’s okey. I’m not and never will be super tiny and light because I wasn’t built that way. I’ve finally come to accept that. 
Look at my plump cheeks, chest and arms in the second close up. I look happy! And I AM! I can actually eat delicious food again (I love bread), and have energy for drawing and studying and hiking and playing the piano and ALL the things I like, because I did.not.give.up. I faced my fears HEAD ON and now I’ve figured out that I’m freaking invincible, because I could the ONE THING I was most afraid of in the e tire world. 
So my message to you all is this: I want you to take a good, hard look in the mirror and reconsider not taking that piece of cake and or that extra serving of dinner. You can’t fix your problems this way. You can’t just focus on starving yourself or working out 24/7 because it’s madness and wasting away your life. You can’t starve away how your bones where built. Let your body be what it’s supposed to be, and try accepting it for it’s flaws
I’m still struggling with it, but I am never gonna give up trying, every single day. This is anti “thinspo”. I want none of you to go through the hell I’ve been through., waste a decade of your life over shit like this. It doesn’t just go away over night, if you get an ed you will suffer the consequences of that illness for life. I still have no idea how to eat correctly, how much or even what to eat. Please don’t destroy yourself. Be good to your body because it’s the only one you’ve got, and it needs you so desperately to keep it healthy and good. You are so worth it. If I can do this, so can you! Now go fight, be brave and let yourself LIVE!  
self-care is not selfish! (not my drawing, tell me if you know the author!) 
I have spent most of today in my pyjamas. No, I haven’t been for a run in Nike leggings or taken a photo of my beautiful overnight oats with 40 different organic toppings…because my friends….for most people, that is not recovery. Instead, I have eaten when I was hungry. I have had biscuits and toast and chocolate and fruit and a doughnut for good measure. I have had normal portions of hospital food and also a whole bar of chocolate so to be honest I am feeling pretty gross. No, I haven’t been taking photos of every meal or singing about my battle, instead I have eaten in private most of the time and with shame. But this is the start of recovery to me, not ‘clean eating’ or ‘raw til bloody 4′, it is ENJOYING food despite the guilt, despite the urge to purge. So honey, if you’re trying to recover and are put off by photos of ‘weight restored but still a size 0′ or little miss ‘recovered and only eating organic vegetables picked by japanese virgins’ then IGNORE THEM. If that feels right to YOU and not your ED, try it. If you need to lie in bed eating chocolate and toast YOU DO THAT!!! Reactive eating is scary and feels out of control but it is what it is - REACTIVE - to what your eating disorder has done to you. Your body wants to be healthy, you need to trust it. Good luck recovery bitches xxx
