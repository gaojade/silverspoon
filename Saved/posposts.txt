If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
fyi there is no such thing as “getting back on track” after the holidays because you were never “off track” you were simply living life because you are a human being and you deserve that 
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
You deserve love. You deserve good energy. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you. You deserve to love who you are. You deserve to be at peace. 
Losing weight will not increase my value. Gaining weight will not decrease my value. I am allowed to take up space.  
Reminder: You survived even when it felt impossible to do so 
your body cannot be wrong because there is no right way to have a body 
daily reminder: your weight does not dictate your worth 
Your eating disorder will never willingly let you go. It’s never going to say to you one day, “Okay that was fun while it lasted. I’m done here!!” It just wont. You are its oxygen, the fuel to its fire, its home. It feeds off of your self-destruction, your vulnerability, your logical self. You could be seconds from dropping dead and it will still tell you, you are not sick enough. It’s not a diet, a fad, or a trial period. It’s a life-threatening mental illness with one intention: to kill you. Believe me, you are sick enough. But you are also strong enough to beat it. 
Who am I to wage a war on a body whose only goal is to keep me alive & healthy?? 
If you’re reading this, this is a gentle reminder that you are enough – as is, right now.  
Healing is everyday work. Do not expect yourself to be okay overnight. Let yourself heal gradually and over time. 
Your body burns 15-20% more calories just by existing and you need to eat more to sustain your energy!  Don’t feel bad that you’re eating so much, either – your body needs it! 
you know what doesn’t matter? what other people are eating. seriously. stop. just because your friend karen got a salad does not mean you shouldn’t have the pizza. order that fucking pizza and do not for a second think you’re worth any less than her 
We’ve all heard opinions others have of us. You’re weird. You’re shy. You’re ugly. You’re poor. Who knows what you’ve heard people say about you. But you are not who they think you are. You know yourself better than anyone. You get to determine who you are. Not someone else. No matter what you hear someone else saying about you, you get to determine the truth behind it. 💜
When you start feeling insecure remember: we were all born with confidence, and we can all get it back if we learn to silence the - negative - thoughts that threaten it. Above all, remember you are capable and worthy, regardless of what mistakes you’ve made, regardless of what you’ve achieved! 
quick list of body feel good things:i pinky promise you are not going to wake up looking different after one day (even one week) of “bad” eatingbut also NOBODY is going to have a flat tummy at the end of the day, i mean itset point theory says your body has a range it knows it needs to be in to be healthy & safe & normal and it’s going to fight to stay in that range because it wants to protect you. it just wants to protect you!!the thicker your thighs are the more kittens can lay on your lapyou eat more/have more cravings on your period because your body is burning calories! it’s working harder and needs more energy!clinically obese is one thing but “fat” ?? is not a bad word?? who tf decided it was?? in fact, beauty standards for victorian women involved being rounder. there’s literally no wrong way to have a bodyyour body tells you when it’s hungry— listen. it knows what you need and what’s best for younever underestimate the power of taking a shower or taking a walkyou are alive today bc your body is fighting for you. it’s protecting you from disease & harm & other dangers. it carries u around and keeps u safe. be kind. 
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
I think a weird part of eating disorders is that when you look at people who weigh more, have rolls, fat, cellulite, you don’t see them as ugly. I didn’t look at people and think “God they should eat less.” Because they were and still are beautiful. In fact there were many actors and friends who I thought were stunning regardless of their weight, it wasn’t a factor because they’re just pretty. But when I looked at myself, all i saw was ugly, fat, bad, distorted. So how can we do that? Look at all of our friends, and still think they’re perfect, and look in the mirror and say we’re not? “Because I’m not” you tell me. But you’re wrong. I look at you and I see beauty, I see how unique you are and how no one else can compare because you’re you. Your eating disorder is lying to you, don’t let it steal your happiness, ask for help. 
Fun fact: restricting does not solve your problems 
YOU DON’T HAVE TO WORKOUT TO EAT
you deserve to nourish your body today and every day 
I am becoming the person I want to be. Fuck you if you don’t like her. I like her. She’s doing her fucking best and her fucking best FUCKING ROCKS.  
you do not have to hurt more for your pain to be valid.  
Shoutout to trans people who are trying to overcome eating disorders that are intertwined with their physical dysphoria!It can be hard to separate the two when you’re trans in a world that genders your body shape and fat distribution, but it’s important to keep on fighting the unhealthy urges even when you can’t love your body for what it is. 
The hardest thing to hear when you’re weight restored from an eating disorder is, “oh, so you’re cured now?”It always fills us with an odd feeling. The feeling that our emotions and thoughts are no longer valid as we are no longer underweight. But, I just wanted to remind you that:You can still have an eating disorder if you’re at a healthy weight or if you are overweight.Your thoughts are valid.It is okay to express how you are feeling.You are such a wonderful person, who has fought so damn hard to get to where you are now, don’t let any comments take that away from you. 
•These problems do not define you. 
•Relapses don’t undo your progress! 
•You’re more resilient than you know. 
•You’re worth it, so never stop fighting!
•Recovery is full of ups & downs; it’s never linear. 
•Give yourself a break– you need time to heal. 
•Your body is perfect. 
•Every body is perfect, flaws and all. 
•You’re worth more than your physical appearance. 
•People love you for who you are. 
since it’s national eating disorder awareness week, here’s a picture of me that’s pretty recent. i may not be super toned or have abs anymore like i did at this time last year, but i’m also not eating less than 1200 calories a day and overexercising like i was last year. this is me. this is my body. it’s healthy. last year when i looked “fit”, i wasn’t. my body was so malnourished that after i got home from college i didn’t even have the energy to get out of bed anymore, let alone work out. i was 110 lbs and still thought i was fat. i wasn’t even able to get my period for several months because i wasn’t feeding and treating my body properly. so this is me, healthy. how much do i weigh? i have no idea, and i don’t care. i’m happy with my body and my stomach (which was the place i used to hate the most on my body) but my stomach is cute and it’s rolls when i sit down are cute and i don’t care if i don’t fit into society’s rules of “skinny” or whatever. i’m healthy, and that’s good enough for me 
friendly reminder that you’re never going to look back on your life when you’re 80 years old and wish you had spent more time counting calories and less time living  
EAT WHAT YOU WANT, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT, KISS WHO YOU WANT 
Becoming less of yourself will not heal the parts of you that hurt 
That food is simply a conglomeration of energy and nutrients that help power your cells which keep you breathing and thinking and movingThat calories have no moral valueThat weight is an arbitrary measure of your relationship to Earth’s gravitational pull and in the scope of the universe the difference between Earth’s gravitational pull on any given human compared to any other human is infinitesimally insignificantThat the mirror will lie to youThat you are not a bad person for taking care of yourself or nourishing yourself or addressing your needs or taking up space 
that health is a state of being, not a body type 
Food is not something you have to earn, it’s a need you have to fulfill no matter what you did or didn’t do. 
if you’re trans and you have a restrictive ed please remember that your body does not have to be small to pass. you’re perfect the way you are and you losing weight will not cure your dysphoria. you’re just gonna end up dysphoric and ill. the control an eating disorder pretends to give you is fake and please don’t let it take until you’re in the hospital because you blacked out going up some stairs to realize that. 
The hardest part about trying to recover FULLY from an eating disorder and STAY recovered this time is that it’s a permanent, daily process. I have to actively decide and choose recovery every moment of every day. It’s not something on a list I can just accomplish, check off, and move on to the next thing. It’s a permanent item on my daily list. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around and accept that. 
Sure, loving the way your body looks is a great goal but there’s also something to be said for the slow discovery that it just doesn’t matter to you as much as so many other things anymore. 
Your eating disorder is a terrible translator. ‘I’m a size 10′ is translated into ‘I’m worth less than those who are a size 8 or 6 and should be a size smaller’; this is wrong. What it really mean is ‘I’m a size 10.’‘I ate pizza’ quickly becomes ‘I’ve eaten 735 calories of carbs and fats and I need to exercise and purge and fast tomorrow’; once again, ‘I ate pizza’ simply means ‘I ate pizza’. ‘I gained weight’ seems to mean ‘I am lazy and should be ashamed of myself, I am fat and a fake’; the reality is, it just means ‘I gained weight’.‘My BMI is healthy’ turns into ‘I don’t have an eating disorder and need to lose weight to prove I’m sick’; as you can guess, this phrase still only means ‘My BMI is healthy’.Don’t listen to these shitty translations because they are wrong. The phrases don’t need to be translated, they are factual and mean nothing more than they appear to. 
seriously, i don’t think people with eating disorders get enough recognition for getting through the day. all day their eating disorder voice in their head is screaming “YOUR FAT” “DON’T EAT DINNER” “DON’T YOU WANT A FLAT STOMACH?!!” “STOP EATING” “YOU’LL NEVER LOOK LIKE THEM” “YOUR UGLY” “THEY DON’T LOVE YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE FAT” and then there’s the panic attacks, the constant debating of what to eat, when to eat, whether to eat, there’s the sitting next to the toilet bowl and deciding whether to throw up your food, or stick at recovery and keep it down, then there’s avoiding the kitchen so you don’t binge, or getting changed where there are no mirrors so you don’t have to look, there’s the debating whether to step on the scales, and when you do you end up crying, and checking it again and again, as if it would change. and yet, you get up everyday and try and tell yourself that today will be different, you try and soothe yourself, and tell yourself that you are beautiful, and you put your nicest outfit on, you eat your breakfast, and you eat your dinner, and you try your hardest to keep it down, you try and ignore the voice, and go against it, you keep fighting. and, you just don’t get enough recognition. you are strong, you are beautiful, you are BRAVE, my god you are so brave. you aren’t a failure, you aren’t no good, you aren’t crazy. i wish i could hug you all and let you know what a great job you are doing, you are surviving, you have made it through everyday, and you’ll make it through many many more. you can do this, i believe in you. i’m proud of you. 
Fuck diet culture 
One day you’re going to fight off the urge to relapse and it will be the last time you ever have to again, because you will be recovered.And I think that’s worth fighting for. 
YOU DON’T NEED AN EXCUSE TO EAT 
Note to self (and anybody else who needs this)You want to please people and stop their worrying about you? Then eat.You want good relationships? Then eat.You want to be able to laugh and celebrate and drink with your friends? Then eat.You want to do well in your education? Then eat.You want to maintain your employment? Then eat.You want to go on that dream holiday? Then eat.You want to be warm when everyone else is? Then eat.You want to get your period back so you can have kids one day? Then eat.You want to build bone density so that you’re not a fragile old woman by the time you’re 25? Then eat.You want your lips and the skin on your hands to stop cracking? Then eat.You want to experience new things, possibilities, and tastes? Then eat. You want to fucking live?Then EAT. 
We hold onto what hurts because we have become comfortable with it. Let the pain go. Let yourself become comfortable with what feels good. 
One day you will look back and think about all the beautiful memories and moments in your life.Not about how your body looked. 
Though #gainingweightiscool we have to remember that #edrecovery is not about getting dat ass and going from skinny minnie to fit babe (or hunk).For some, recovery means going from a body type deemed socially acceptable and desired, to one deemed less “wanted” and less represented in media, simply because their bodies were never meant to be a size small.By maintaining a body weight under their set point weight range they would have had to hold onto eating disordered behaviours such as restriction, excessive and rigid exercise and food rules that causes mental and/or physical harm. And let’s not forget many people with eating disorders aren’t, never were and never will be skinny. That does not make their condition less valid nor their recovery less impressive.The people I find the most inspiring are those who haven’t gone from one obsession to another, e.g. doesn’t follow a rigid diet where their entire cupboard is from Whole Foods and Iherb, and doesn’t go to the gym rather than seeing friends. I get inspired by free people. Brave people who embrace themselves and start a life that is not 90% centred around food and body.Listen to me;You have not done recovery “wrong” if you don’t have a perky bum and feminine curves, or for males - a toned body with muscles. Recovery is not about getting hot or #strongnotskinny, it is about freedom. - @amalielee​  
GUESS WHO’S BACK! This past year for me has been all about recovery and growing mentally & emotionally strong- and I’m at a point now where I’m proud of the progress I’ve made! I wanted to make a little graphic about the 5 things I’ve been practicing that have undoubtedly brought more fulfillment, love and brightness to my life ♡
People get so mad when I say that I believe all dieting is wrong and unhealthy??? There is no healthy aspect of pressuring people into believing that losing weight will improve their lives and encouraging them work toward a lower weight goal. Getting healthy is something I stand behind 100% but that means eating more leafy greens, learning how to love and care for your body, making sure you’re not taking in too many processed “food” products, doing cardio exercise, etc. For a lot of people that will result in weight loss, but that should not be portrayed as the goal. Focusing on aesthetic beauty rather than inner health is wrong and harmful to everyone involved. This should not be controversial. 
please learn the power of saying no. please learn the power of defending yourself without an explanation. it won’t feel good at first. there will be guilt and shame and questioning; but i promise you, you are worth it. say no. fight for yourself. listen to what your soul needs. be your own advocate. nobody else has the right to take that away from you.  
Never ever feel unworthy of recovery because your symptoms change all the time or are less frequent. You ARE sick enough and you DO deserve recovery. OSFED (other specified feeding or eating disorder) is the most common eating disorder and is the most dangerous because it can goes years untreated. Do not let ED tell you that you are ‘less sick’ because it is all lies to stop you from getting help. 
Reminder: being thin isn’t my life’s work. I am so much more than that. 
FUCK DIET CULTURE, LOVE YOUR DAMN BODY.LOVE YOURSELF.YOU DESERVE SELF-ACCEPTANCE! 
reminder: you do not have to get worse before you can get better. your recovery lies solely in your hands.  
self confidence was THROUGH THE ROOF TODAY 
food isn’t something you have to earn.eating isn’t something you have to deserve.food is fuel and energy and survival.be nice to yourself.give yourself permission to eat.it’ll be okay. 💜 
something that’s stuck with meseeing people recovered on instagram. and not ‘recovered’, but actually embracing how they look and eating freely — cake, pizza, ice cream, yet also salads, fruits, veggies.they’re proof that recovery is REAL and that it’s WORTH IT.if recovery wasn’t worth it like your eating disorder tells you, then why have these people stayed recovered when they could have gone back? why would they not return to their eating disorder if it was as shit as our ed’s tell us?because it isn’t. it’s worth it, and these people are proof. proof that you can succeed without it, proof that you can be happy without it, proof that you DON’T NEED IT. 
it’s raining outside and i can’t stop thinking about how much of my life i’ve devoted to making myself unhappy. how many times i’ve said no to things that might make me smile. how many times i’ve looked in a mirror and pinched my skin, begging it to become empty space. how many nights i’ve torn myself apart for not being enough, for being too much, for being. how many years i’ve shattered my own heart because it felt like what i deserved. i was wrong. i have had terrible things done to me, but i don’t have to be like the people who did them. i’m allowed to be happy. i’m allowed to take care of myself.i was wrong. i deserve to be okay. and please, pause for a moment and think - there’s a chance you might be wrong too.  
their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  
FATS ARE FRIENDS! 
stop listening to serving sizes and start listening to your body  
Don’t wear tight/too small clothes - I know you want to cling to your tiny jeans but, as someone told me in inpatient ‘they fit your eating disorder really well’ - bin them, take them to charity, sell them, trust me it will feel better
Eat what YOU want - not what the eating disorder wants. Sure, some people in recovery post beautiful salads and smoothies and if you feel like that sometimes then enjoy it but if you want chocolate or McDonalds or a dounut, why not? It doesn’t invalidate your illness or recovery or make you a bad person, it just means you are listening to yourself instead of the ED
Base your recovery/plans on YOU, not other recovery blogs - I’ve never made myself a calorie goal or meal plan in recovery, I’ve just based it on how I feel whilst being realistic about knowing how much I need to eat and when I’m hungy or full. If a meal plan works for you or your team have set it then that’s great, if not, that’s cool too
Don’t weigh yourself. Seriously. For the love of happiness and nature and all things good, throw those damn scales away. It brings me to tears to think of the number of girls (and boys) defining their worth as people by that stupid F-ing number
Ask for all the help you need - it looks different for everyone, it could be going to your GP, private therapy, school counsellor, a helpline, or just friends and family. I’ve always found it easier feeling like those aroung you are fighting the illness too
Make sure you’re not trading one behaviour for another. Its amazing if you haven’t binged/purged/over-exercised/taken diet pills for however long but if you have replaced that with another behaviour or diet, becoming veggie or vegan, ask yourself is that healthy for you at the point in recovery you are in or is it fuelling your eating disorder?
Be immensely totally proud of yourself every single day and moment you choose recovery.
 Very often, when people with eating disorders fear recovery, it is not really about the fear of weight gain, or the fear of foods. They might make it to be about that, both to others and to themselves, but truth is, it is often not that simple.It is a fear of losing your identity. You might feel as though you’ve become your struggle, and if your eating disorder left you thin, you might feel being “the thin one” is your identity or purpose.It is a fear of the expectations from others, and society, that comes when you are no longer ill (or “visibly ill”). Now you have to face the world, and you can no longer blame your illness.It is a fear of losing your coping mechanisms. An eating disorder is often a tool to deal with whatever curveball life has thrown at you.It is a fear of letting go of the stability and safety of eating disorder. All these rules and restriction might have given you a sense of predictability. Recovery is messy and unpredictable.But truth is, if something is trying to kill you it is not safe. If something leaves you miserable in the long run, it is not a healthy way to cope. If something leaves you isolated and unable to live a normal, rewarding life, it is not sustainable. Our worst enemies are the ones disguised as helpful friends. Please do not let the lies of an eating disorder seduce you to death. 
you have come so much farther that you ever thought you would, conquered every demon you thought you never could. even if you feel at the lowest of your lows, give yourself credit for the tremendous progress you’ve made. you are capable, you are strong, and you’re going to be alright.  
You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 
I never do this sort of thing but it’s eating disorder awareness week and I’m posting a before and after photo to show all my progress in recovery!  You can really see the light in my eyes!  So happy!        
My body is not your business.My body is not yours to comment on.My body is not here for your approval.My body is not your body. 
I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me.I cannot allow my negative thoughts to control me. 
I’m done denying myself life and happiness because of trying to be something I’m not. I’m a broad-shouldered, big hands and feet northern woman with a big bone-frame, and I’m finally proud to say that… that it’s okey. I’m not and never will be super tiny and light because I wasn’t built that way. I’ve finally come to accept that. 
Look at my plump cheeks, chest and arms in the second close up. I look happy! And I AM! I can actually eat delicious food again (I love bread), and have energy for drawing and studying and hiking and playing the piano and ALL the things I like, because I did.not.give.up. I faced my fears HEAD ON and now I’ve figured out that I’m freaking invincible, because I could the ONE THING I was most afraid of in the e tire world. 
So my message to you all is this: I want you to take a good, hard look in the mirror and reconsider not taking that piece of cake and or that extra serving of dinner. You can’t fix your problems this way. You can’t just focus on starving yourself or working out 24/7 because it’s madness and wasting away your life. You can’t starve away how your bones where built. Let your body be what it’s supposed to be, and try accepting it for it’s flaws
I’m still struggling with it, but I am never gonna give up trying, every single day. This is anti “thinspo”. I want none of you to go through the hell I’ve been through., waste a decade of your life over shit like this. It doesn’t just go away over night, if you get an ed you will suffer the consequences of that illness for life. I still have no idea how to eat correctly, how much or even what to eat. Please don’t destroy yourself. Be good to your body because it’s the only one you’ve got, and it needs you so desperately to keep it healthy and good. You are so worth it. If I can do this, so can you! Now go fight, be brave and let yourself LIVE!  
Ain’t nothing wrong with touching thighs, just look how happy that kitty is to be there!!!Originally posted by cutekittensarefun 
Eating disorders are stupid because they make you forget how fucking good a fresh baked brownie is and that’s that.  
You have permission to recover You don’t have to be at death’s door to recover. You don’t have to have a dangerously low BMI to recover. You don’t even have to be underweight to recover. You don’t have to be formally diagnosed with anorexia, bulimia, or another eating disorder to recover. You don’t have to be skin and bones. Your hair doesn’t have to be falling out. Your body does not have to be shutting down in order to recover. There is no such thing as “not sick enough”. If you’re looking for a sign that it’s time to seek recovery, to start on the journey to seeking and getting help, this is it. You can get help. You can recover. You have permission.  
ED Recovery blogs::Please like or reblog this if you are a personal ED recovery blog.I feel like the ed recovery community has almost disappeared from tumblr over the past few years and has mainly moved to instagram, which is sad. Like//Reblog this if you are working in recovery and hopefully we can help support each other/celebrate victories together. Recovery does not have to be a road you walk alone x 
Eating is a necessity, not a privilege. Love and care for yourself. @madsrecovers 
Sometimes you’ll eat too many cookies when you’re enjoying life. You’ll eat salads when you need more vitamin K, or some extra dinner when you’re still hungry after a first helping. Maybe you’ll go for a run because you like to, or you’ll swim laps in the pool because it’s hot out. You won’t count how many calories you’re burning because you’re living. You care about your livelihood and health. You will be living and you’ll be happy – this is recovery. And it is wonderful. 
Wanting and willing are two very different experiences.You can want good grades, but that means nothing without being willing to study.Similarly, you can want to recover from your eating disorder, but without being willing to change behaviours, gain weight, challenge rules etc etc, you are not going to get very far.On the other hand, you don’t have to want recovery (at least initially) in order to be willing to change. You can be willing to give gaining weight a go without wanting it. I can assure you that the majority of recovered people out there would agree that they didn’t necessarily want to make the painful changes that recovery demanded. But they were willing to try.Be willing to try something new. Be willing to have an extra bite of dinner, to sit down instead of run, to nourish rather than punish. It is far too easy to become trapped in a state of wanting and wishing change without taking any actions. It is not enough. Don’t let your illness trick you into thinking it is. 
I am tired of being hungry, I am tired of excuses not to go out, I am tired of searching up numbers on plastic bags, I am tired of the taste of water, coffee and green tea, I am tired of letting myself down, I am tired of punishing myself every time I eat, I am tired of punching myself on the stomach every time I feel full, I am tired of smelling like vomit because of what I did on the bathroom, I am tired of looking at skeleton girls wishing I was them.There are so many reasons why I want to recover…. I felt trapped here on this blog because I have 6k people following me here and I know this number will go down with this decision but I don’t care (actually I do because this means that you don’t want to recover and I want you to recover but oh well….). You are all so important to me and I know how hard this living hell is, this is why im fighting against it. And you can do this too because if I can do this you can!! I believe in everyone here and I believe WE can be happy without ana. Right now she is screaming in my head saying that I can do this to her, that I have to be thin and pretty and look like a sick person so people can worry about me but I am telling her to fuck off. Guys you can always message me and I will always be here for y'all! Send me a question or ask for any tips on recovery! I will also post here what I do to motivate myself when Im down or pics of my recovery journal (and poetry as always)! Loads of love and kisses for u!! Stay safe (FOR REAL) and go eat that piece of cake you wanted so bad) :))) 
four years in recovery today.
messy hair, sleepy eyes, crazy day, full heart. 
that’s what happens when your life becomes much bigger than your eating disorder. 
If you never eat, you will still feel fearIf you only eat half of what you need, you will still feel fearIf you fully nourish your body, you will still feel fear.Your eating disorder is lying to you. You will not become untouchable of you give in. So embrace the fear, the pain, and the discomfort. But embrace it from a healthy, unrestricted perspective. Like physical wounds, you will heal much better if you are taking care of yourself. 
please remember that just because someone’s recovery looks a certain way does not mean that yours needs to look that way too. recovery is about becoming friends with your body again - YOUR body. so listen to it. honor it. trust it.  
Either way, you’re a warrior. Don’t forget it. 💜 
friendly reminder:💫 you are a wonderful person💫 your mental illness is a piece of crap💫 you deserve recovery💫 you deserve happiness💫 you can do this, stay strong!💫 there is always someone who cares about you💫 you are not alone 
Just let it go. Shake it off. Remind yourself this is no longer serving you. It is okay to no longer entertain what is not helping you grow. Whatever it is that’s stopping you from being you, just let it go. 
Messages to those struggling with an Eating Disorder from someone in recovery***disclaimer that I am in no way a professional therapist. I am simply speaking from my own experience with ED recovery and struggling with an eating disorder***-I’m so proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for staying strong. I’m proud of you for being alive. I love you-it doesn’t matter how much weight you have or haven’t lost, if you are hurting your body you are hurting it period. You don’t need to lose a specific amount of weight to have an eating disorder. It is classified as a MENTAL disorder for a reason. You are valid no matter what and just because someone’s disorder may look “worse” than yours doesn’t mean yours isn’t bad. I don’t care what you say, you are VALID.-you deserve recovery no matter what. You hear me? NO MATTER WHAT.-If you say you “haven’t been sick long enough” Nonono you can recover whenever. WHENEVER! Eating disorders aren’t linear. You don’t have to be sick for a certain amount of time to considered “officially sick”. There is no “time spent suffering” requirement. You could be damaging yourself as soon as you start engaging in behaviors. You are valid and you deserve to get help whether it started weeks ago or years ago.-If a doctor says you can’thave an eating disorder because you aren’t underweight go to another doctor. Fuck them. Fuck anyone who says that to you. That’s not true at all. Throughout my whole eating disorder I never once looked sick. I was never once underweight. But I was so sick mentally. Please don’t let anyone tell you those horrible things. It’s just not true and doctors and psychologists have proven that it’s not true. -Your disorder is still valid even if no one sees it. I see it. I hear you. I’ve been there. You are still valid no matter what. You still deserve help. I love you.-No, you aren’t the only one these rules DON’T apply to. Even if you don’t believe it, this applies to you.-No matter what mistakes or failures you have made in your life, you never deserve to hurt yourself. -You will NOT be nothing without your disorder. You have amazing characteristics that are just being masked by the disorder. If you were to recover, you would find new amazing passions and skills you never even knew you had. You will not be nothing without your disorder. You will be everything. -Recovery is so scary and so hard, it means facing your worst fears. Believe me I know. But once you get over that initial hurdle and start healing mentally and physically, it gets easier. I swear 100% it gets easier. Your life gets better. You feel alive again. You feel free. You feel liberated. You feel like you could dance in a field of wildflowers. -For most people, eating disorders develop because you don’t want to face the pain and trauma in your life so you use it as a coping skill to numb yourself. And once you realize that it can make recovery even more scary. Will I be in even more pain? What do I do if it becomes too much to deal with? I promise you that facing your pain is a lot less scary than it seems. Yes it is hard and heartbreaking and terrible. But destroying yourself with a disorder isn’t going to fix it, it isn’t going to make that pain go away. Temporarily yes, but it will always be there until you face it. Your disorder isn’t helping you. It’s going to hurt you even more than you’re already hurting.-Relapses will happen, even if you’ve been in recovery for years. BUT, they do NOT mean your progress has been erased. You have hit a speed bump not a road block. And you will be strong enough to get through it. I believe in you.-When you have an eating disorder you miss out on life. I don’t remember anything good about my life last year. All I can remember is counting calories, crying, and purging. You deserve to enjoy life. You deserve all the good things in life. You don’t deserve to suffer at all. -Your eating disorder will do nothing but hurt you and destroy you, it makes you miserable and sad. Skinny doesn’t equal happy no matter what! I promise you it doesn’t. You wanna know what does make you happy? Eating ice cream with friends. Enjoying the taste of chocolate. Being able to go out to eat and not have to google the menu beforehand. Not having to count calories every single day and night. Not crying over food. Being able to enjoy living and not constantly destroying yourself. No matter who you are, you never deserve an eating disorder. Even if you feel like you do, even if you feel like a failure or disgusting or a loser. You will NEVER EVER deserve that disorder as a punishment. You wanna know what is disgusting? The disorder. You wanna know who’s beautiful and strong and amazing? YOU. Please never ever forget that.  -Recovery is possible and always an option, and you will always always deserve it. 
Note to people struggling with eating disorders:It’s easy to forget that the way that you view the world is different than the way everyone else does. The illness puts a filter over things so that you don’t see reality. The truth is that even though you might see all the little changes in your body and the so-called “imperfections”, the average person doesn’t pay attention to those kinds of things. Theres no way they’ll notice  if you gained ten pounds, let alone whatever changes you feel happened overnight. Due to being sick you have a preoccupation with these things that others don’t have. It’s easy to think that the way you see the world is normal, but in the disorder, it’s far from it. The average person doesn’t think about someone’s weight when they meet them; they see them for all their other traits first. The disorder has trained you to pick any body changes out in order to keep yourself sick. But in reality, these things don’t matter at all.Remember this next time your disorder tries to tell you that everyone will judge your shifting, recovering body- in reality, they’re too wrapped up in their own lives to notice whatsoever. 
maybe things are getting bad again. maybe you’ve been doing so well, you’ve really, genuinely felt yourself getting better - and suddenly you’ve slipped and found yourself stuck in the very same dark hole you fought so hard to climb out of. i know you’re disappointed in yourself. i know you’re angry and frustrated and beating yourself up and losing hope of ever getting better with each passing second. i know. but I want you to know that it’s okay. you’ve been fighting so hard and I’m so proud of you. one slip up doesn’t erase all your progress. recovery is still within your reach. always remember that you’ve fought your way through this before and made it out alive. this time will be no different.  
I will grow from this 
Glorify recoveryGlorify full meals, a good nights rest, and doing your best. Glorify making the consious decision to be better. Glorify the daily struggles to do whats best and ignore the evil whispers your disorder wants you to trust. Glorify winning those little, silent victories. Glorify feeling warm, full, and refreshed. Glorify health and happiness and caution. Recovery can be beautiful if we rest during our bad days and rejoice on our good days. Weather you are moving up or down, you are still moving forward. Glorify recovery, not illness.  
Hey just some lil things for you to remember!You haven’t eaten too much (even if you binged)Any food is good food!You need carbs, fats, fibre and sugars! Have a look up the daily recommended intake of those if you want more info, but don’t obsess over it! It is just a recommended intake amount.Your body looks gorgeous today! Everything about it is stunning ♥Don’t purge please, it’ll make you feel worse and it doesn’t even get rid of calories, don’t hurt yourself over food.Please be wary of pro-ana/mia blogs! They will just make your mindset worse, surround yourself with happy and positive things and people.Keep exercise to a reasonable amount for your intake.You are loved and you are beautiful, I promise!If you need someone to talk to I’m always here ^u^ 
- if a food makes you happy or you crave it a lot, have some! depriving yourself of food is just gonna make you crave it more and when you finally snap you will binge eat 10x more bad things than if you just had this one small thing
- recovery takes time !!! lots of time !! ive had my ed for 5 years and ive fallen in and out of recovery and its hard but it is doable!!! 
- ive lost more weight nourishing my body with healthy things and exercising a few times a week than i ever did starving myself
- self love is not a sudden thing. no one wakes up entirely in love with themselves. it takes time and energy and yes ! its okay not to like certain things about yourself but they make you unique and most of the time they cant be changed and thats okay!!!
- thigh gaps r not for everyone!!! not everyone can achieve a thigh gap! it completely depends on your bone structure, you could be at the lowest weight possible and still not have a thigh gap because of your bone structure but thats okay! thigh gaps do not determine your worth as a human (but if you do have a thigh gap thats fine too! everyones bodies are different)
- eat more fruit and veggies!!! honestly!!! blend them in a smoothie or cook them or eat them with chocolate, who cares!!! they will help ur skin, ur hair and ur mood as well as many other benefits. try and eat at least 2 or 3 portions a day because yes theyre expensive and not everyone can manage 5 a day. 
- u are allowed to treat urself with unhealthy food!!! ur body is smart and can cope with u eating a slice of cake or a bar of chocolate
- u should not fear food!!! food is ur friend!!! especially healthy foods, but also unhealthy foods for when u need them.
- throwing up your food does more damage than it ever will do good. it is so bad for ur emotional and physical well being and is found to make u gain more weight than lose it ! 
- u shouldnt feel the need to lose weight. if u want to do it in a healthy way thats ur choice but people see more in you than just a number or a body i promise
- your ed will not vanish overnight. it takes months, maybe years of recovery to feel fully recovered but you can get better everyday and it will be so worth it when you look back and think about how far u have come !!! ❤️ 
But recovery is. 
Eat to be healthy. Exercise to be strong.Restricting is not healthy. Obsession is not strong. 
Living with a disorder like BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), can be so draining. Everything is black or white, emotions are red hot or ice cold, love is anxiety ridden or bordering on hate. The hardest part? Knowing that we are too intense for most people to handle. 
But you can’t always focus on the bad aspects of things. You have to take the good with the bad. So even though there are intense ups and downs, I always know I’ll get back up again and still love, have hope, and try to keep going. I may break easy and crash hard, but when I’m high and in love, nothing can stop me. 
Keep going and live for the ups, the downs only prove how good the ups are and allow you to enjoy them fully. 
Small reminder that recovery is worth it.
Small reminder that recovery is possible.
Small reminder that YOU are capable.
YOU CAN DO THIS AND YOU WILL. 
Sometimes it may seem as though you do not have a hold on your life anymore or you’re not the one controlling the reins. Sometimes it seems as if somebody else has taken ahold of them and aren’t steering you very wisely.  Sometimes it may even seem as though that happiness is too far gone to get back. Maybe your heart is so big that every little thing has an impact on you and tears you down. Maybe somebody just straight up tore down your walls and you feel as though it would take a nation to build them back up. But you’ve forgotten one major detail and fact. YOU are the only person in charge of your own happiness. You are still here, so it is never too late to have that happy feeling back once again. You are in charge of your own thoughts and of the negativity that you allow into your life. Isn’t it amazing that we have such a power? Take advantage of that power, and be happy once again. Not for everyone around you, but for yourself. Sometimes you do have to be selfish, and it is okay! Because that feeling you’ve been missing is a very important aspect in your precious life. Let’s take control and get it back!  -Ariana 
It’s okay to recover.It’s okay to gain weight.It’s okay; i’m okay.My life is not over because I have gained weight.The people I love are happier now that i’m healthier than they were when I was struggling.I am happier now in recovery.It’s okay to recover. 
But I’ve noticed that I’ve been getting better. My energy is starting to come back. I feel stronger and I’m for confident I can fight what stands in my way.
Don’t give up as hard as it gets, as heavy as it gets. Find somebody who will help you lift the weight and I promise it will all come back to you💜
one of the essential steps in making peace with your body is wearing clothes that are comfortable. bras or underwear that dig in, waistbands that are very constricting, shirts that make you self-conscious so you never bend over… that stuff is right out. if you’ve only ever chosen clothes for how they look or whether they’re “flattering”, or if you’ve recently had a change in your body size/shape, explore what makes you feel comfortable. do a body scan when you’re wearing an outfit and if there’s a bad feeling anywhere, switch that item with something that feels good or neutral. it can take a while to learn how to dress comfortably; it did for me.issues of gender expression or lack of resources to obtain new clothes can definitely complicate this. but in general, be as kind to your body as you can with the clothes it spends day after day in. 
ok ok but ya know what i’m realizing?? HAVING AN EATING DISORDER IS SUCH A WASTE OF MY LIFE. in the time I devote to my ED, how many more people could I help?? how many more laughs could I have? how many more breathless moments could I experience? how many beautiful runs could I go on? how much of the patriarchy could i crush?? I AM JUST DONE. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR. THIS IS NOT WHO I AM. I CANNOT CHANGE THE WORLD WHILE HAVING AN EATING DISORDER 
Today is my birthday and I’ll eat a slice of cake. I won’t purge after. I will eat that damn thing and it won’t make me immediately obese. It won’t. It won’t. I promise myself it won’t. Today anorexia won’t win.  
Fuck anorexia and the idea that I would only be good enough when I was thin 
- Your ED is lying to you- Losing more weight will not make you love yourself more- Losing weight will not make the people around you love you any more than what they already do- Eating normally again will truly make you feel better physically and mentally- Weight loss does not cure a negative body image.  And long as you continue to have a negative view of yourself, you will never like how you look, no matter how much weight you lose. 
Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 
‪You have every right to be yourself. Own it. Love it. Be exactly who you are and don’t ever apologize for it.‬ 
Recovery is gaining fat even though you hate yourself. It’s crying while eating, but forcing yourself to do it so you can survive. It’s eating foods that are scary to you and not limiting yourself in any way!!! It’s not all sun shine and fucking rainbows. 
I’ve been going to therapy for just over a year now, and there is one appointment in particular that was monumentally life-changing. My therapist and I were discussing my self-destructive, self-sabotaging behavior. She asked me, why is it that I continued to choose to act in a way that I know hinders my recovery? And I said that I didn’t know, but that I wanted to get better, and promised that I would actually try this time, that I would begin actively correcting the poisonous, negative self-talk that had become so routine to me. I was lying, and I knew it. She knew it too. So she called me out on my bs - she shook her head, told me she didn’t believe me, and said something that put a lot of things in perspective for me: if you keep holding onto this self-destruction, it means it gives you something that you’re afraid to lose if you get better. I didn’t have an immediate answer to what that “something” was. So I thought for a few minutes. And suddenly it clicked. The thing I was afraid to lose by getting better was the validation my mental illnesses and destructive behaviors gave me. I thought they validated my pain, my bad days, my bad feelings, and if I recovered, it meant that I had no right to feel bad anymore. And the fear of losing that validation caused me to cling onto my mental illnesses to the point where they became my identity. I had no idea who I was outside of my screwed up brain chemistry and the traumatic experiences I’d gone through. And for the first time since I started therapy, I cried in that office. So what I want to tell you is this: your pain is valid regardless if you’re at your lowest point or in recovery. Having good days doesn’t erase the fact that you have a mental illness - if anything, your good days are proof that you’re capable of conquering it. I know it’s not so simple to just go cold turkey on bad habits and immediately embark on your road to recovery. But to anyone struggling with mental illness, I just want you to know that you are so much more than the pain you’ve gone through. And choosing to heal is all the more proof of that.  
There is no magical target weight which you must maintain for the rest of your life. A BMI of 19, 20, whatever, does not mean you are recovered, it just means your weight is only just considered healthy
You are allowed to eat more than your meal plan - don’t view it as strict rules, as long as you are eating ENOUGH, you can always eat more
Eat foods that YOU like - sticking to the same foods everyday or choosing ‘healthy’ options all the time is your ED talking, eat cake, eat mcdonalds, eat a salad then chocolate, enjoy food
Recovery is not measured by weight. I repeat RECOVERY IS NOT MEASURED BY WEIGHT. You could be your highest weight and seriously ill, you could be a low healthy weight and be recovered, being a certain weight does not mean the MENTAL illness is cured
I am super proud of you and you should be too x
You’re working hard, you’re doing well, you deserve to rest. 💜 
You really deserve to 💜 
reblog/like this post pls !! i need more recovery experiences/inspiration/hope/etc in my dashboard ✨
friendly reminder that you made it until this point in your life. you went through so many struggles and you’re still here. i’m so proud of you, keep fighting 🌞💛💫🌻 
Sometimes it is planning relapses late into the night, and then getting up the next morning and making breakfast regardless of how much you want to run in the opposite direction. Sometimes it feels like you are losing all control over your life and that every little change is magnified a thousands times over.But just because you feel this way right now, and may spend hours planning your next relapse, it does not mean that you have ‘failed’ or ‘messed up’. No.Recovery is a journey; it is a learning curve. It is not always going to be a straight road, but that’s okay, no one said that it was going to be ‘easy’.Your feelings and emotions, whatever they may be, are very real and valid.  You are allowed to feel this way. And yes, it is okay to be having ‘second’ thoughts, however don’t lose sight of the reality of the situation; don’t let yourself get caught up in the numbers and the games. This is your life at stake here; and you are currently playing with fire. Giving into those disordered thoughts may ease your anxiety in the short-term, however it won’t last long, and it will always come back for ‘more’. Relapse is not the answer. Although the storms may be raging in this moment, they will not last forever. They will pass by and the waters will settle. You can and you will get through this. Hold on. 
Weight restored 🌜🌛 
Your body is your friend, not your enemy. 
Really hoping I heal from all of this and I live a beautiful life and can be at peace

02/08/17Posting this purely to piss off anorexia. Chubby face. Spot break out. Who cares. Screw you. I want to live not just survive. 
You need to recover regardless.
Wanting to love who I am means I’m going to have to stop all of this. To stop punishing my body, who I am, and how I feel. To let go of this. To not allow it to ruin things for me. I have to give up all of its control over me. I have to live because living is not this 
Trying to love yourself is really hard. Recovering from many years of an eating disorder, depression, and anxiety is hard. Praying that I get there. Praying. Praying. Always. 
I want to recover so that - I won’t think about food all the time and I can focus on uni- I can enjoy food again-I’m happier- It will stop ruining or damaging relationships-I can live my life-I can eat out without so much anxiety and worry-I can spend my time doing stuff I actually like than working out or endlessly calculating -I can be more peaceful and emotionally stable -I can talk to others freely and openly -I can stop hating myself and become more confident 
You are not alone. Maybe there are not as many of you posting about it on social media. There may be fewer blogs and vlogs chronicling the process or inspirational accounts with people your age going through this experience. Maybe there are less of you who recover and then come back to tell your stories. But, even if you don’t show up as much on instagram and tumblr feeds, you do exist.You see, eating disorders don’t magically stop when you reach 30. Many of you have developed ED’s after giving birth. Some go through midlife and the stress of that provokes your genetic predisposition. OR you notice a resurgence of ED thoughts in your 30′s, 40′s, 50′s and beyond when you thought you had recovered as a teenager. It happens. I’ve seen all of the scenarios above and more play out. I’ve also observed that it is extra hard to reach out when you are an adult who is struggling. Suddenly there is rent or a mortgage to worry about. There are children involved. There is a job you don’t want to lose. I get it. So many others get it. You just don’t post about it as much. I used to wonder if it was possible for an adult, who had struggled for years, even decades, to recover. But I’ve seen it happen. I know women in their 50′s who are just experiencing freedom from their ED for the first time in their adult lives. It isn’t easy, but I am telling you that it is possible. I know it is easy to feel alone when you are recovering as an adult so I want to encourage you to find the support you need. ED’s thrive in isolation. Connection is critical. This is me giving you a big virtual hug and hopefully the little nudge you need to reach out. I am holding space for you to do the tough stuff needed in order to get well.Peace & Blessings,Rachel 
Haven’t had actual pancakes in years so ya recovery is pretty dope 🥞 
i’ve always wanted to rock overall shorts, but my body image and lack of self confidence always made me hang them back up on the rack whenever i found a pair i liked.yesterday, i said fuck it. i tried them on and bought those suckers.small wins, folks. small wins. 
There’s a ~40 lb difference between these two photos. Gaining this weight gave my me life back. 
Dear Georgina, You are deeply intelligent, strong as fuck, and within you lives a celestial universe; a divine goddess. You do not have to live in an eating disorder. You don’t have to numb and be smaller and harshly blunt your enthralling, creative, divine femininity. Now you’ve cultivated the tools to fight like hell against your mental illness. Darling, please always take up infinite amounts of space. 
I don’t have to like my body, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like that I have to eat, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like the discomfort that comes with meals, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like the struggle of fighting purge urges, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like recovery, but I need to accept it.I don’t have to like myself, but I need to accept myself.–Inspired by wise words from my dietitian  
so! i’m heading into my first summer of recovery, and i’m trying to make the most of it while staying healthy and focused on my future. these are a few of my plans to optimize my summer while keeping it worthwhile, fun, and safefind some habits you want to build. they don’t have to be big things, but it is nice if they’re things that make you happy. personally, i want to start cooking again, be consistent with my journaling, be creative at least once a day, and maybe start exercisingwhat are some things you’ve been meaning to get done? whatever you didn’t have time for during the school year, especially if it would make your life easier in the future. i’m going to be doing a thorough cleaning and organization of my bedroom, remaking my spotify, going through the photos on my computer and deleting the unimportant ones, and retaking my codeacademy courses on html and cssif you’re anything like me, summer is the loneliest time of the year, because you don’t have school bringing you and your friends together every day. instead of isolating yourself and waiting until september to see everybody again, try to plan some time doing activities with other people! volunteer, find an internship, hang out at the cafe on your corner every morning until you start talking to the other regulars. make plans to meet up with old and current friends, relatives, and other people you lovedon’t stress yourself out. sleep in an extra hour, stop scheduling your time down to the minute, take time to relax and be bored and do nothing. don’t spend all of your time being productive. summer isn’t the time to get burned outat the same time, don’t spend too much time doing things that don’t contribute to your short-term joy or your long-term happiness. i try to differentiate between time spent on games, media, and other things that make me happy in the moment, and time spent doing things simply because i’m bored (scrolling through buzzfeed or social media, watching bad tv shows, and playing candy crush). i’m not saying that you should avoid these things entirely, but don’t let them take up too much of your time. you don’t want to spend your last few days of summer wondering what happened to your weeks of free timetry to find yourself again. work on your mental health. go to therapy, or find cbt and dbt worksheets online. build up strength for when you need it most. make an emergency box for mental health crises, find something to fidget with when you’re anxious, learn what works for you and what doesn’thave fun! break the rules sometimes. nothing has to be set in stone. make some memories for the year ahead, but don’t sabotage your future in the process 
On June 1st, I’ll be 6 months clean from bulimia. It really does get easier. Hang in there. 
you are more than enough.  
🌸🧬💘💓Life really is too short to be worrying about how my body looks and what I eat. It’s time to just be happy and free and enjoy this life🌸🧬💘💓

If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
For the past couple of weeks I’ve been stuck in this under eating (not restricting really but not eating enough) and over eating (not binging but eating more than I should). I can’t help but want to lose weight again, and I even have been trying to do so, but then the next day I feel guilty for doing that and eat more. I’ve also been really depressed lately and feeling really unworthy so my ed has been resorting to either restricting or binging as a coping mechanisms.I feel like crap about it, someone got any advice? I know I should stop counting calories but I just can’t help it, it makes me (well my ed rather) feel safe. Ugh, recovery is hard. 
Choose recovery,Choose recovery again,And again,And again, and again, and again, and again.  
things you need calories for: solving equations or writing poems to fight for things you care aboutkeeping yourself warm to sleep well at night and stay awake during the day to be happy  
For all of you out there having recovery as your new years resolutions: I am rooting for you with all my heart and I sincerely hope you achieve your goal. 
Did you know that when you eat enough food every day your mood is improved, your body doesn’t hurt, and you have the energy to accomplish tasks throughout the day? What a wild, novel concept. 
your body cannot be wrong because there is no right way to have a body 
if you’ve had a rough few days lately, please know that there will be a day when you’ll wake up and things will feel easier. you’ll see the good in things, you’ll feel the warmth in your heart again, I promise <3

Just as its never to late to start recovery, it’s never too early either. You don’t have to fall a certain amount before you can pick yourself up. The longer you hold getting help off, the harder it will become later. So take a step today; have a shower, go outside, talk to someone. Whatever it may be for you, do one thing to better yourself. I know your future self will thank you for it. 
If you ate something, I’m proud of you. Unconditionally.  
I think a weird part of eating disorders is that when you look at people who weigh more, have rolls, fat, cellulite, you don’t see them as ugly. I didn’t look at people and think “God they should eat less.” Because they were and still are beautiful. In fact there were many actors and friends who I thought were stunning regardless of their weight, it wasn’t a factor because they’re just pretty. But when I looked at myself, all i saw was ugly, fat, bad, distorted. So how can we do that? Look at all of our friends, and still think they’re perfect, and look in the mirror and say we’re not? “Because I’m not” you tell me. But you’re wrong. I look at you and I see beauty, I see how unique you are and how no one else can compare because you’re you. Your eating disorder is lying to you, don’t let it steal your happiness, ask for help. 
Let’s… let’s try to be a little kinder to ourselves in 2019, yeah?  
Even when food feels hard, you need to eat.You’re body needs fuel, even if the lies in your head are convincing you otherwise. You don’t have to deserve food. If you’re hungry, there is nothing wrong with eating, no matter how much you’ve had that day.  
Food is necessary and good! no matter what kind of food you end up eating, you’ve done something good.  
food gives you the energy to smile. It gives you the energy to hug your friends or pet cats. It’s like sunlight for a plant- you can’t flourish without it. Let yourself grow 
Just a little reminder that…RESTRICTING will make you feel worse!!!FASTING will make you feel worse!READING LABELS will make you feel worse!WEIGHING YOURSELF will make you feel worse!NONE of these things will solve your problems! They never have before and they never will! 
You deserve to eat, your body deserves nourishment. You are beautiful and you are worth taking care of. If you are looking for permission to eat something, here it is, please eat.. even if it’s small. If you were thinking about food or eating and you saw this, it is a sign you should eat. If you’re feeling hungry, it is a sign you should have something to eat, no matter what or how much you’ve already eaten. You are beautiful and deserving of love and food and weight do not change those facts.  
some recovery things:you may lose friends or have to distance yourself from them. if they have unhealthy habits or are toxic people they can be detrimental to your recovery. it’s okay to let them go. there isn’t necessarily a rock bottom so don’t wait for it to come. only you can decide you want to recover. only you can put that work in. there are certainly people that can be supportive but ultimately it’s your choice and it’s your responsibility.  recovery is a journey. it takes time and for some people it doesn’t necessarily have a finish line. it’s okay to go at your own pace. your recovery might be be slower than someone else’s and that’s okay. sometimes it gets worse, a lot worse, before it gets better. there’s a lot of thoughts and behaviors to unlearn and it’s not easy. you have to make a conscious effort. some days will be better than others and that’s okay. it doesn’t mean you’re failing. it’s okay if you’re not in the place to help someone else.  
Even wanting to want recovery is a step in the right direction. Take a leap of faith. You might fall down, but it won’t hurt nearly as bad in the end.  
bro i can’t wait to feel comfortable in my body 
I am not my body. I am in my body. But I am so much more than my body.  
It’s important to find a purpose and an identity outside your eating disorder. Here are some small examples of things that might help take care of a plant and watch it growlearn how to fix your clothing or other things and start doing itjoin a local community for an interest you enjoy and see how you can help out make jewlery or badges or buttonslearn to knitstart doing the things you used to enjoy as a child write poetry or stories None of these things will fix your eating disorder, but they can make it easier to let go of it. And having practical hobbies that let you see visible results and get positive reinforcement for them can be amazing.  
and realise how very brilliant you are at surviving. Panic attacks, bullying, difficult relationships, physical health problems, mental illness?YOU SURVIVED ITSuicidal thoughts, plans, even attempts?YOU SURVIVED ITNot thinking you could live another day?YOU SURVIVED ITAnything that’s really hard right now?YOU’RE GONNA SURVIVE IT 
your value is not linked to looking a certain way. you can find happiness and meaning outside your eating disorder. 
Happy ThanksgivingYou are allowed to enjoy your food, to eat according to your preferences, to eat to the point of satisfactionYou deserve to enjoy this holiday, however that may look to you (NOT to your ED, or judgmental/unkind relatives)You can eat thanksgiving dinner AND eat breakfast and lunch and snacksYou can eat thanksgiving dinner AND all your meals AND not compensate for it before/after the holidayIt is also okay to struggle with this day and have negative emotions….remember you’re not alone in that. We’re all in this together.If the people around you make harmful comments about food/dieting/eating/anything tbh….It is not meant for you. It does not apply to you.

little helpful things you can do before going to bed:- get a glass of water in case you get thirsty during the night- pack your bag- write a to-do list- plan what you’ll wear tomorrow- make lunch for the next day (& breakfast if you want!)- wash and moisturise your face 
There’s nothing wrong with gaining weight. You are not ugly, you are not weak, you are not a failure. You are beautiful, you are strong, and you are going to be okay. 
Get angry at your eating disorder. You are allowed to be angry. Use your anger to fuel your recovery.  
Everytime a thinspo blog follows me, i think and hope that following me will be their first step towards recovery. I’m cheering on you all! 
we’ll keep going, and we will make things better every day until we aren’t just surviving we’re gonna thrive  
good evening friends, I know some of you are really struggling right now but things will get easier and you will get through it, remember to be kind to yourself and to fight the negative voice in your head, don’t let it win  
Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth. Weight is not a reflection of your worth.  
you don’t have to make up for large meals, there’s nothing wrong with indulging. You don’t have to punish yourself for it.

one day, when the sun kisses your bare skin, you will no longer fear feeling exposed. the rays will dance on your exposed legs and warm your back with their kind touches. you will laugh as waves splash mist into your face and point out tiny silver fish to your companion and buy ice cream from the little stand on the boardwalk. you will lie in the sunlight in your swimsuit and smile, remembering how far you have come. once upon a time you cried when you looked in the mirror and when you stepped on a scale. you hated every bit of food that crossed your lips and wished you could count your ribs like matchsticks. you could hardly stand to show your face in public, let alone strut half-naked on the beach. but here you are.alive, surviving, recovering, happy. the journey was not an easy one by any means, and there are still hurdles you will have to overcome.but here you are, finally free.

If I lost 50 pounds, I wouldn’t be able to…Take care of my new dogPlay with the kids I babysitWalk to work every dayHave healthy adult relationshipsShow care & support to my partnerGet up the stairs to our apartment Cook nice food and take pics of itMaintain this blog Keep my jobGo on trips overseas Stay in my own homeEat food in any enjoyable mannerSleep, at allLaughAnd honestly in corners of my brain, I’d love to look as sick as possible, BUT at this point in my life there is simply too much to lose; so I stay heavier than I want to be and happier than I ever would be if I were ill.  
When was the last time you made a soothing, well-needed drink and snack just for the sake of enjoying it all by yourselfNot having to seek reason or validation from another being to be able to just simply feel worthy enough to do soWhen was the last time you sat down and allowed yourself to feel loved and feel complete and feel like you don’t need any other external reason to dictate whether you’re worthy of simply enjoying living your own lifeYou’re worthyYou don’t need to have validation, reason, or for it to be a special occasion to be able to enjoy your time and to be nice to yourself. You don’t have to earn self-compassion; not through friendships, work, or any other factor. Food is not a reward, you don’t have to do something or be like someone in order to be able to have it and fully enjoy it. And frankly, you are more than enough.  
The curves on my body are proof I am enjoying my life. With every party, every cake, i’m learning to love my life again. Every curve is a reminder of how good my times were. A reminder of how good they will be. 
You deserve to recover..• if you were never hospitalised• if you still get your period• if you were never technically underweight• if you still ate every day (yes sweetie, you’re still valid)• if you don’t think you’re sick enough (I promise darling, you are)• if you’re underweight, a normal weight, overweight.Anyone and everyone deserves recovery, and you’ll get there one day, I promise ❤️ 
Do everything you can to stay away from toxic communities. That might mean staying away from the internet when you’re feeling vulnerable, deleting blogs you’ve made that are harmful, or avoiding people who are making your issues worse. You don’t owe communities or people who are hurting you anything. Get out of there as soon as you can. You deserve space to heal.  
If you’re reading this, it’s a sign to go eatEven if you don’t think you’re hungry ‘enough’. Even if you think you’ve already ate too many calories.I know how it feels to be anxious about eating and feeling like you don’t deserve the food. Every now and again I get some thoughts telling me not to eat. But please nourish your body, it needs food!Go eat, you deserve it. You deserve good things. 
I apologize for hurting my body when it just wanted to keep me alive :( it’s super cute and makes me happy :)) 
I’m so proud of you if you ate something today. No matter how much you ate, no matter what- eating is good.  
You deserve to travel to another country you’ve always dreamed of visiting. To walk the streets, sipping on a pleasant drink unfamiliar to someone of your culture. To stop for a mid morning and afternoon snack, not because you’re necessarily hungry, but because you see a fantastic baked good in the café window that would bring a smile to your face and please your tourist body and mind. You deserve to sit down for a reservation at a restaurant that appears at the top of the list of best places to eat in that country. To start the meal with a thick slice of their locally baked bread with a slab of butter on top. To order a local favorite you’ve never tried before. To drizzle an unusual but intriguing sauce on top that the waiter swears is to die for. To have the waiter persuade you into taking a local favorite dessert back to your hotel room. To sit in the hotel loveseat facing the window view and eat it slowly, taking in the city. You deserve to travel without an eating disorder. You deserve to live without an eating disorder, and experience every joy life has to offer.  
Ain’t nothing wrong with touching thighs, just look how happy that kitty is to be there!!!Originally posted by cutekittensarefun 
being able to stop making excuses to meet with people in case there’s foodgetting a snack at the cinema just because being less tired feeling confident in your clothing being able to look in the mirror for only as long as you need to check if you look okay and then go about your day seeing your friends smile when you eat somethingcooking food for yourself and not just for others 
Listen, you deserve to be happy. No matter who you are, where you’re from, what you’ve done in the past, and where you’re headed tomorrow - happiness is for all, including you ✨ 
you’ve already done so well. and i am so proud of you for the recovery process you’ve started. relapsing is part of that. don’t give up now, you’ll get there! <3 
Friendly reminder (mostly to myself) that you have a whole bunch of organs n shit all snuggled up inside your abdomen and losing more weight isn’t gonna make them go away!!  Your stomach can’t always be perfectly flat!  Having bumps and pouches on your tummy is literally part of normal human anatomy please don’t be mad at yourself if you can’t have a smooth/flat stomach! 
2019 is the year I finally let myself live again. I’m speaking it into existence.  
Eating disorders are stupid because they make you forget how fucking good a fresh baked brownie is and that’s that.  
{your disorder is lying}{you are enough} 
Eating is a victory. Feeding yourself even though it’s hard is something to celebrate and be proud of.  
{I’m sorry you’re in so much pain.}{You don’t deserve it} 
Your now is not your forever.-John Green  
Me, who knows I deserve recovery regardless: 
Recovery is so so so fucking tough, but I can be tougher. I just have to push and push and push. I refuse to let this disorder take my life from me again. 
It’s been1 whole year of recovery today. Recovering from disordered eating is not an easy path. It is a lot of ups and downs, relapsing, fighting, setbacks and hard work. It’s a slow, slow battle. But I would never want to go back to where I was and I wish to encourage people to follow my lead. Always feel free to message me.  
Yall gotta understand that eating disorders do not discriminate. they can strike at any age, any gender, any size, any race. they aren’t just skinny, white, middle-class teenage girls. not all eating disorders are anorexia and bulimia. binge-eating, EDNOS/OSFED, pica, avoidance, orthorexia…the list goes on. you can’t tell if someone is sick by looking at them. the idea that eating disorders always look a certain way causes so much damage to those who do not fit the stereotypical “ED look.” A major issue I had when getting help was thinking that I wasn’t sick enough to need it. I don’t look like I have an ED, I’m not rail-thin or white or sixteen. I don’t have a traumatic past, I am still mostly functional. I don’t need help because I’m not that bad yet.Bull. Shit.eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. EATING DISORDERS DO NOT HAVE SIZES.you deserve help. you deserve to live your life free from obsessing and worrying and planning and weighing. even if you don’f fit the “type,” even if you think your ED “isn’t that bad.” any amount of ED is bad. any severity deserves to feel better. be brave. be free. 
I am not as thin as I used to be, and that is okay.I no longer can feel my bones jutting out, and that is okay.I no longer have a considerable gap between my legs, and that is okay.It is okay, I am going to be okay. 
Reasons to eat regularly and keep eating regularly1. To be engaged in my life2. To have the energy to enjoy exercising3. To be able to go out for meals and not be overwhelmed by anxiety over the food4. To not be thinking about food all. the. time.5. To feel warm
If you don’t like your body and catch yourself getting caught in a thought spiral about how much you don’t like your body: get out of your head and do something with your body.Draw a picture, take a walk, heck, throw some rocks around if you can.  Life gets better when you stop caring about what your body looks like and start appreciating what it can do. 
The number on the scale does not mean I will stop eating.The number on the scale does not mean I will stop trying to love myself.The number on the scale does not mean I am a failure.

The sun is up, the sky is blue, it’s beautiful, and so are you 🌼 
In case you needed reminding: Healing is not a linear process. 
ice cream is the best thing in the world and i hope y’all allow yourselves to enjoy it all you want because you deserve it 💛🍦 
This time last year I seriously thought I would have to go the rest of my life living like that. But here I am as a testament that it will be okay. You will be okay. 
just some concept playlists pt. 1I hug you and bury my face in your neck. It’s been a hard day, I feel sick, but I can feel your heartbeat with mine, I can hold you close and pretend that we’re the only thing in this world. Because right now, you and I, we’re the only thing that matters.It’s the 5th day of school after summer, you’re in math class and the cute girl you kinda sorta have a crush on has to work with you and your friend on a small project.Going through a breakup, recovering and learning to love yourself, for the first time or all over again. Things will be okay, just give it time.You’ve just run away, its 5:30am and you’re drinking bad motel coffee while watching the sunrise, you can hear the cars on the nearby highway and everything seems alright for onceYou’re walking around your old hometown with a friend. It’s a cool summer evening, and the sunset is bright behind the dry hills that you can see in the distance. You want to capture this feeling because you know you’ll have to leave soon, and don’t know when you’ll be there again.Every minute feels like an hour, every hour feels like a day, every day feeling like forever, but it’s okay because I’ll wait forever and a day for you.You feel lonely but you make someone smile and you remember why you’re here. It’s lonely, it’s scary, but it will all be okay. Just keep going.EMERGENCY POSITIVITY BELOW! You know how amazing you are? So freaking amazing that the universe had to give you some bad days because you were getting Too Powerful! You’re so lovely you practically glow! Everyone around you can’t help but stare. You deserve so much love, so stay safe and kick ass.

eating is a victory. celebrate it.  
Messages to those struggling with an Eating Disorder from someone in recovery***disclaimer that I am in no way a professional therapist. I am simply speaking from my own experience with ED recovery and struggling with an eating disorder***-I’m so proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for staying strong. I’m proud of you for being alive. I love you-it doesn’t matter how much weight you have or haven’t lost, if you are hurting your body you are hurting it period. You don’t need to lose a specific amount of weight to have an eating disorder. It is classified as a MENTAL disorder for a reason. You are valid no matter what and just because someone’s disorder may look “worse” than yours doesn’t mean yours isn’t bad. I don’t care what you say, you are VALID.-you deserve recovery no matter what. You hear me? NO MATTER WHAT.-If you say you “haven’t been sick long enough” Nonono you can recover whenever. WHENEVER! Eating disorders aren’t linear. You don’t have to be sick for a certain amount of time to considered “officially sick”. There is no “time spent suffering” requirement. You could be damaging yourself as soon as you start engaging in behaviors. You are valid and you deserve to get help whether it started weeks ago or years ago.-If a doctor says you can’thave an eating disorder because you aren’t underweight go to another doctor. Fuck them. Fuck anyone who says that to you. That’s not true at all. Throughout my whole eating disorder I never once looked sick. I was never once underweight. But I was so sick mentally. Please don’t let anyone tell you those horrible things. It’s just not true and doctors and psychologists have proven that it’s not true. -Your disorder is still valid even if no one sees it. I see it. I hear you. I’ve been there. You are still valid no matter what. You still deserve help. I love you.-No, you aren’t the only one these rules DON’T apply to. Even if you don’t believe it, this applies to you.-No matter what mistakes or failures you have made in your life, you never deserve to hurt yourself. -You will NOT be nothing without your disorder. You have amazing characteristics that are just being masked by the disorder. If you were to recover, you would find new amazing passions and skills you never even knew you had. You will not be nothing without your disorder. You will be everything. -Recovery is so scary and so hard, it means facing your worst fears. Believe me I know. But once you get over that initial hurdle and start healing mentally and physically, it gets easier. I swear 100% it gets easier. Your life gets better. You feel alive again. You feel free. You feel liberated. You feel like you could dance in a field of wildflowers. -For most people, eating disorders develop because you don’t want to face the pain and trauma in your life so you use it as a coping skill to numb yourself. And once you realize that it can make recovery even more scary. Will I be in even more pain? What do I do if it becomes too much to deal with? I promise you that facing your pain is a lot less scary than it seems. Yes it is hard and heartbreaking and terrible. But destroying yourself with a disorder isn’t going to fix it, it isn’t going to make that pain go away. Temporarily yes, but it will always be there until you face it. Your disorder isn’t helping you. It’s going to hurt you even more than you’re already hurting.-Relapses will happen, even if you’ve been in recovery for years. BUT, they do NOT mean your progress has been erased. You have hit a speed bump not a road block. And you will be strong enough to get through it. I believe in you.-When you have an eating disorder you miss out on life. I don’t remember anything good about my life last year. All I can remember is counting calories, crying, and purging. You deserve to enjoy life. You deserve all the good things in life. You don’t deserve to suffer at all. -Your eating disorder will do nothing but hurt you and destroy you, it makes you miserable and sad. Skinny doesn’t equal happy no matter what! I promise you it doesn’t. You wanna know what does make you happy? Eating ice cream with friends. Enjoying the taste of chocolate. Being able to go out to eat and not have to google the menu beforehand. Not having to count calories every single day and night. Not crying over food. Being able to enjoy living and not constantly destroying yourself. No matter who you are, you never deserve an eating disorder. Even if you feel like you do, even if you feel like a failure or disgusting or a loser. You will NEVER EVER deserve that disorder as a punishment. You wanna know what is disgusting? The disorder. You wanna know who’s beautiful and strong and amazing? YOU. Please never ever forget that.  -Recovery is possible and always an option, and you will always always deserve it. 
it’s almost New Years and I know that a lot of people will make it their resolution to lose weight. but really? that’s not a good resolution. it doesn’t help the world become a better place. it doesn’t help you become a better person. this year, please don’t make it your goal to become smaller. if you’re going to make a New Years resolution, make it something that brings love into this world instead of more hate and fatphobia and support to an industry that profits off our insecurities. instead you could try deciding to:- unfollow any thinspo/fat shaming/negative accounts- eat when you are hungry- stop looking at calorie content for food- stop negative self talk and replace it with positive self talk- follow positive accountsor if you want something that’s not realated to food/weight at all, maybe:- compliment people more often (and maybe try to keep it away from compliments on someone’s body and weight)- read more- send a kind message to someone every day- reach out when you need help- call people out on bigoted comments or languagethere are a million resolutions you could make to bring a positive influence into the world, and losing weight is not one of them. 
hey there. have you eaten something today? I’m so proud of you if you have. if you haven’t, please do, you deserve it too. 
you ever eat just to flex on your eating disorder 
I didn’t choose recovery once,, i have to choose it everyday. and if i relapse i can’t let it affect my choice tomorrow…you gotta leave it in yesterday and take the new day in ur hands and say “today i choose recovery!”  
Glorify recoveryGlorify full meals, a good nights rest, and doing your best. Glorify making the consious decision to be better. Glorify the daily struggles to do whats best and ignore the evil whispers your disorder wants you to trust. Glorify winning those little, silent victories. Glorify feeling warm, full, and refreshed. Glorify health and happiness and caution. Recovery can be beautiful if we rest during our bad days and rejoice on our good days. Weather you are moving up or down, you are still moving forward. Glorify recovery, not illness.  
2019 is the year I become a kitchen witch and start feeding myself properly and magically. 
I promised my therapist I wouldn’t become one in five. It’s a frightening statistic that rings true. One in five with an eating disorder will either commit suicide or die from the medical complications of their illness. On days where I can’t find any other reason to choose recovery, I choose it to not break my promise to her.  
Just tryna be proud of my body :-) 
throughout my recovery, i have done every single one of my fear foods. fast food is the one thing that i have not been able to do and haven’t had in over 10 years. today, i said a big “fuck you” to my eating disorder and did it. i am so fuckin proud.  
Less than a week into recovery and I have so much more energy!!! I haven’t painted in months and I had the energy to paint two animals in just a day. Yes, recovery is HARD and I look like I’m 20 months pregnant from all the bloating but honestly? It’s worth it. I’m so much happier. Fuck my ed. I hope he chokes on all the bread I’ve been munching on ✌️ 
Over the past months I’ve managed to:- usually eat three meals a day- get used to drinking calories (next to eating them)- stabilize my weight (including a healthy bmi)- limit excessive exercising- stop weighing every day/multiple times a day- stopped purging- try some new foods and fear foods- (mostly) get over my fear of proteinsAnd all that without help from the eating disorder facility because those ass fucks dropped my case or something.I can do this by myself. I am my own biggest supporter. I am done with my eating disorder and I can live without it.  
{there is more to life than being skinny} 
Recovery feels so much better 😊 
What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being.What I eat has nothing to do with my worth as a human being. 
Split.A part of me still feels like I don’t deserve “recovery.”A part of me feels like I didn’t even have a problem to recover from.A part of me feels like I failed because I never reached my goal weight.A part of me feels like I’ll run back to my old habits, sooner or later.A part of me wants that part of me to shrink to nothing.A part of me wants that part of me to stay. 
You deserve to eat. You deserve to be healthy. You deserve self care. You deserve to live.  
You ate today? You stayed hydrated? Got enough sleep? Proud of u!!!!  
yo….. anorexia takes the shit u love and crushes it. dont trust the bitch. 
Fuck anorexia and the idea that I would only be good enough when I was thin

Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 
Sometimes I feel guilty about treating myself to something like a little peanut butter on my toast if I haven’t ‘earned’ it by doing extra exercise or something and let me tell you,you don’t have to earn eating anything.  You deserve to treat yourself even if you haven’t done anything extra to earn it. 
Today marks 3 months since I decided to recover. It’s definitely been hard, and had its ups and downs, but honestly thank god I decided to recover. Who knows where I’d be at today if I hadn’t. 
All in all, today I’ve been able to enjoy my recovery by eating what I wanted, not what my eating disorder wanted. For breakfast I had chocolate oats, for lunch a hummus avocado wrap, and for dinner some homemade pesto pasta! I enjoyed every second of every meal. Here to a long, amazing life full of good food and art ✨
i want to fall in love with being aliveand one day, i will 
I’m not fully recovered, but I’m so much happier than I used to be. It really does get better 
A lil sunburn and a lil acne but we’re thriving in this beautiful weather 🌼 feeling really good and confident today!   
I know anorexia recovery isn’t about the weight. But sometimes it feels like it is. Some days in recovery, all you can see, all you can feel, is your body and how it’s changed. It feels impossible to live with. It feels like accepting your “new” body will never happen. And it does. Slowly, over time. A little over two years ago, I wrote a post about struggling to accept my body. I was four months post-treatment the second time. I had weight-restored to a higher weight than I had the first time around, and I was sure that I wouldn’t make it. And I did. I took the energy I had previously put into losing weight and applied it to recovery instead. I went to therapy, I ate my meals and snacks, I didn’t relapse into restriction, over-excercise, or purging. I did the hard things. Here I am today, just two years later, living life completely symptom-free, accepting my body as it is, even loving it at times. I used to give my power away, to allow the number on the scale to define my worth and value. I have taken that power back. I define myself by what I love. I find myself to be inherently worthy, simply because I’m human. I didn’t know this kind of life was out there waiting for me. And it was. And it’s waiting for you too. 
Life is so much better when you can go eat some crackers or cookies when you’re hungry in the middle of the night.   
It’s okay if your trauma didn’t make you a better person.It’s okay if your trauma didn’t make you stronger. It’s okay if it didn’t help you grow. If it didn’t make you a better person. YOUR STORY IS STILL VALID. You are still an inspiration. You’re still every bit as brave for being here today than anyone else. You don’t owe anyone anything. Trauma doesn’t always lead to strength and growth and becoming a better person at the end of the day. If something ruined your life, or changed it for the worse, you’re allowed to say it did. Not every bad experience turns into something good. You’re still every bit as much a hero of your own story as anyone else. Don’t let anyone tell you your trauma needs to result in something good. You are not your trauma. You do not need to include it into your story if you don’t want to. You do not need to appease anyone and say you’re stronger because of it.  
bowl full of self love <3 
friendly reminder that you made it until this point in your life. you went through so many struggles and you’re still here. i’m so proud of you, keep fighting 🌞💛💫🌻 
Eating a little more than you planned to/ eating some extra dessert doesn’t mean you’ve ruined your day. It doesn’t mean that you’re going to gain a bunch of weight. It doesn’t mean you should go and eat as much of whatever you can think of because you believe you’ve already messed up so you might as well throw everything else away. What it does mean is that you let yourself indulge a little and that’s ok. 
This message honestly MADE MY DAY <3 I’m so glad I was able to give you a new perspective. Eating is a way to honor your body and nourish your spirit. The eating disorder can never take that magic from you. Keep fighting love. 
“The people who don’t get better from an eating disorder are the ones who stop trying.” —Carolyn Costin and Gwen Grabb, 8 Keys to Recovery 
Recover so you can eat candy without being scared anymore 
I’ve been stuffed with five meals a day for several days in a row and I haven’t gotten fat yet. So in conclusion: if u ate/have to eat some meal today that you worry about, it’s cool - we’ll be ok, you and I. We’ve places to be and things to do but we gotta eat first🍵🌺 
Since it’s NEDA week, I’ve thought that I would reflect on this topic because weight redistribution is a real thing in recovery, yet not a lot of posts are written about it. It’s probably because when it happens and the weight redistributes, most of the sufferers are at a stage in their recovery mentally when they really let go of the disordered thoughts and the whole obsession with body checking, thus they don’t even notice the change. Yet, I was very conscious about my body throughout this whole transformation and I did notice the change. I just never sat down to write about it but now half a year after my weight redistributed, I can say that it’ll happen to you, too, just give it time, give your body time to heal properly.Those who know my story know that I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in 2017 March. I gained weight and lost weight during that year, my weight fluctuated a lot because I was still not fully committed to recovery. It wasn’t until later that year when I also broke free from a toxic friendship that I committed fully to recovery both mentally and physically. I was seeing my psychologist frequently while extreme hunger hit stronger than ever. I gained even more weight than before, I looked like a pregnant girl sometimes because all the weight accumulated around my stomach area and on my face. I looked like I was bloated all the time, yet I knew that I had to give it my all, especially because I wasn’t the best recovery warrior I could be. I wanted to do my best this time and doing my best meant eating properly, eating whenever, whatever and how much ever I wanted.So I did. It was scary, probably one of the scariest things I’ve had to done my whole life and the changes in my body didn’t help either. Though I have to admit that I was talking with my eldest sister about it one day and she said that she didn’t even notice the weight gain, so just know that it’s probably not as prominent as you think. Even if it is, there’s nothing to be ashamed of, you’re healing, your body is healing. I know how frightening it is, I also cried myself to sleep a lot of times, asking if I’ll always look this way, if I’ll always feel so utterly hungry.Yet, time went by and I gained confidence while gaining weight and I just let go of the obsession around my weight. I became less stressed due to the fact that I was over my exams, so I had the whole summer to focus on something rather than my body and weight. I traveled a lot, met up with a lot of lovely people and made many, many wonderful memories. And yes, I also ate a lot of good food while not even realizing the shift in my mind-set. The extreme hunger wasn’t there anymore, it just disappeared. It happened so naturally, and I found my body going back to its set point without me interfering. I didn’t bloat anymore, my face wasn’t so puffy and my jeans fit the same as they did before the weight gain. I was also weighed when I was registered at a new doctor (as I’ve turned an adult that year), and my weight really went back to its pre-ED state. What matters more is that I had energy, I had a healthy menstrual cycle, my hair was growing rapidly and healthily and I could enjoy life as it was.Ever since then, I didn’t see a change in my weight. I don’t know my weight anymore as we don’t have a scale in the flat where I live currently for my uni studies, but jeans fit me the same. It wasn’t an easy road, it took my body around a year and half to find its healthy place and for it to trust me again but it functions properly again, and I couldn’t have been more thankful for it.So if you are going through it, if you are hesitating to start real recovery, I’m telling you to do it! It’s scary, hell, it’s really scary, but it’s so worth it! More about it later this week. :) 
Been feeling pretty insecure in my body lately, so these are from over the summer when I was more confident, but I wanted to participate in body positive selfie night!! This is something that’s really special to me, as I’m learning to love myself the way I am and say f*ck you to my eating disorder. 
The little voice in my head that tells me I’m too much and yet not enough, doesn’t get to rule my life anymore!!! I’m perfectly imperfect and I’m beautiful at the size I’m supposed to be 💕🦋🙌🏻 
Choose recovery every day  
Ok but y'all have no idea how confused I am about how eating normally has changed my body?????? Like bitch I haven’t gotten fat??? My chest bones are still right there but now I have muscles too??? I can see my abs??? I workout so little here and I eat all day long????????¿¿??? mY L1fE iS a LiE 
2019I’m so ready to leave this stupid ass eating disorder in 2018 where it belongs. I’m so sick of dealing with this shit for TEN YEARS NOW. I’m done, over it, finished. Goodbye. See you never. 
{please eat}{healing takes energy} 
So I’ve gained almost 30 pounds since I started recovery and guess what. ..Nothing happened. The world didn’t collapse in on itself. My fiancé didn’t leave me. I didn’t have to drop out of college due to embarrassment. My friends didn’t stop wanting to be seen with me. And literally not ONE person has made a comment about my body changing, aside from those who knew it needed to. I’m not saying everything is better. I’m still not comfortable in my body most of the time and the ED thoughts haven’t stopped. But the world is confirming for me that those thoughts have been wrong. And they always will be, so keep going. 
Haven’t weighed myself in over a week and I’m a constant ball of anxiety BUT Y’ALL. Look dat smile. Dat shit genuine. 🙌🏻 
i think i might be ready to start eating normally again. i’m done with being afraid of food, i’m done with passing out, i’m done with being dizzy all the time, i’m done with being so cold it hurts, i’m done with lying to all my friends and family. it will be rough, but i’m going to try to get better. 
🌸🧬💘💓Life really is too short to be worrying about how my body looks and what I eat. It’s time to just be happy and free and enjoy this life🌸🧬💘💓 
Been really struggling with my eating disorder lately, but trying my best to love the skin I’m in. Big shoutout to @taylorswift for writing this 💕 
Here’s to another day aka another chance to learn to love yourself the way you are ❤️ 
For years, I was in denial about how much of a problem my eating disorder had become. I pushed it further and further down, which ultimately only made me get sicker. This summer was my first time at a treatment program, my first time putting recovery first. It definitely hasn’t been easy; I’ve always been an overachiever/perfectionist, and I can be incredibly hard on myself for not having my book finished, not working full-time, not being where I want to be in my career. However, now I’m starting to realize that if I don’t put my recovery first right now, I’ll never be well enough to achieve all these goals I have in the future. Today I choose recovery so that I can have many, many tomorrows to follow my dreams. 
Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do.It is not a punishment for what you have eatena way to compensate for “extra” calories or just a means to lose weight.No matter where you’re starting at, enjoy the process and be kind to your body, you deserve it.  
🌱 positive affirmations 🌱🍃 I am worthy of love in my life.🍃 I am brilliant, badass and beautiful.🍃 I am strong enough to get through.🍃 I am resilient - the world will not get me down.🍃 The opinion of others does not shape who I am, I shape who I am.🍃 I can do anything I set my mind to and I intend to do great things.🍃 I am ready to receive the good that is coming to me - I deserve good things. 
Do not restrict today!Do not compensate tomorrow!We can do this! 
Friendly PSA: your purpose in life is not to serve your eating disorder. Your purpose in life is to learn, love, grow, and help others and yourself. You can’t do any of those things if you’re actively reducing yourself and minimizing the space you occupy. You aren’t meant to be a list of numbers. You are meant to be a force to be reckoned with. An active eating disorder is incompatible with an active life well-lived. Do not listen to its lies.  
recovery is hard. today i went to the store and bought  some food, but decided that i would instead eat an entire jar of biscoff spread. i’m not going to purge, but i wanna just say this because i’ve been feeling pretty relapse-y lately because my clothes no longer fit. it’s okay if you have bad days. if you’re following this blog because you’re serious about recovery, i’m proud of you. i love you all.  
Sometimes listening to your body is really fucking hard and it sucks. These last few days I’ve been so hungry and it’s been really hard to listen to my hunger and eat. But I’m doing it. Because choosing to eat intuitively is not just about ‘stopping when you’re full!’ as the media likes to paint it these days. It’s also about eating more when you’re still hungry. 
all my people thinking of recovering or in recovery right now- i’m so proud of you, i love you, i believe in you. you can do this. stay strong and stay proud ♥️🥀 
what kind of vile creature do you have to be to post thinspo and toxic ed thoughts in the ed RECOVERY tag? like, i go to this tag when i want to reassure myself that i’m doing the right thing and you put some underweight pictures up and yell at the world that starving’s the best. look, i’ve been there, i get it, anorexia sucks; that’s why  we DON’T WANT TO GET BACK THERE, SO LET US BE. jeeeeez.i’ve seen so many polite posts about this but, dude, every time i see some ~*thinspo*~ in the tag i start cursing like a sailor. it’s just so mother effin RUDE. 
For every meal, I ate a fear food, and I’m so proud! Hello again, recovery. 
Congratulations, my loves! You made it through 2018! I am so proud of you, this year threw a lot of things at you, and you fought through it with bravery. I cannot wait to see what you do in 2019! 
it’s National Eating Disorder Awareness Week. year after year, i struggle to find the words to say. every sixty two minutes this illness will take someone’s life. so this year, i’d like to take time to celebrate those who have made it through the sixty two minutes over and over again. healing is a lifelong journey.with that being said, what’s sad is that as i write this and people read it, a majority will still engage in diet culture crap, body/food shaming (of yourself or others), fitness routines for unhealthy reasons, negative self talk…and a slew of other “socially acceptable because it’s the norm even though it’s actually kinda disordered” type of behaviors and mentalities around food, body, and exercise. recovering from an eating disorder in a disordered eating centered society can feel like the most paradoxical thing ever.we’ve come far as a society in making change and raising awareness but we still have ways to go. i look forward to the day where there is affordable treatment, lower mortality rates, better prevention/education programs, and more stories of hope. i also can’t wait for a culture that is inclusive for ALL bodies and places less judgments and value on body size & food, and instead focuses on how loving & kind we all are. 
In honor of it being National Eating Disorder Awareness week, I want you to know that you are not alone. That if you’re fighting this battle day after day - I see you. I hear you. I am with you. Being more open about my struggles with mental illness has been one of the most uncomfortable and scariest things to do. But it has also brought me growth, understanding, and acceptance towards my illness. Though I say it with reluctance and fear of judgement, I struggle with an eating disorder and have for almost a decade. This disorder is blind and it does not choose favorites. You can be any age, weight, race, gender, religion, social standing, etc. Mental illness does not care who you are and it’s important that people know it can affect anyone. Recovery is undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve ever experienced. I actively have to choose it on a daily basis and some days are harder than others. Though I fall many times, I will always rise because the strength in me is tougher than what tries to break me. Fight today for a better tomorrow. Work hard now for a better future. This illness does not have to take you down with it. So come as you are and let yourself be the beautiful person that you are. If you are struggling and need more help, please contact ‭+1 (800) 931-2237‬ 💙💚 
goodbye ❤️ [15.05.19]idk how many people will see this but i finally started recovering -a while ago- -before it was too late- which explains my absence. im currently in such a better place and mindset and i couldn’t be more glad that i chose recovery.i’ve started watching a youtuber called jen brett and she literally helped me so much. she used to suffer from an eating disorder and her channel is mostly revolved around her life in recovery. she’s such a positive influence and i recommend her to anyone who needs motivation to recover 💗looking back at my old posts on this blog absolutely breaks my heart. it physically hurts how much i hated my body and myself. i don’t deserve that and nobody does. i was so obsessed with counting calories it took over my entire life and i got too distracted. i can’t believe i voluntarily chose a route that could have possibly led to my own grave for the sole reason of pleasing society which cannot even be pleased.the reason why i chose recovery? well i didn’t really choose it at first. finals were coming up so i had to eat properly so i could concentrate on studying. but i promised myself i’d go back to my habits once this finals were over.and they were, but while i was trying to go back to my old habits and struggling with body image issues in the process, i stumbled upon said youtuber, jen brett, and her channel completely changed my thoughts. im now eating in a way people can call “intuitive”. im listening to my body when it’s hungry and im exercising when i want to. i’ve gotten so much happier this way and my relationship with food has gotten a lot better.i realised that restricting myself was just gonna make me go into the cycle of restricting and binging over and over again with no actual progress or positive impact. i was in such a constant battle with my body and what it wants and it was so mentally exhausting. i recommend this to anyone who is struggling from an eating disorder and i hope you all find your way into recovery at some point.im so much happier now and im trying my best to stay away from eating disorder-related social media posts on all platforms so that i can proceed on to my recovery with no set backs.with that being said, im deactivating. so goodbye ED community but i can’t say i’ll miss you because this literally feels like leaving jail lmao. i hope you all leave soon too 💓 
Y'all know what I did today?? 😎😎😎 I chose my own snack 💪💪💪 that’s right folks 👍👍 I thought about what I wanted, decided on it, picked it up and ate it 😼😼😼 Up until today, I have been completely unable to decide on what I should eat, but today during the last snack, I wanted an apple and I had one BOOM pr0GrEsSSs 🙌🙌🙌 
ugh sometimes recovery means making the same realizations over and over and over again until finally your brain is like “huh I guess I actually need to do something about this” and it is so painful but those realizations are important. No matter how many breakdowns and tear-filled nights I have, I’m still feeling and processing and even if it really is the same shit again and again, I have to trust that this will lead to something better.  
It is absolutely exhausting to go through life hating yourself. To over analyze everything you do, think, feel. To replay and beat yourself up over moments that seem so significant but in reality, can’t be remembered in weeks, months, and years to come. How can we live a prosperous, healthy, and happy life if we spend so much time drowning in our own misery? How many times will I have to chose recovery and a better life before it finally sticks? I challenge all of you to let go of whatever mental illness(es) or shackles that are holding you down - kepeing you trapped in your old ways. This year, I want to let go of my perfectionism, my eating disorder, and work on my anxiety and OCD. 🌼 I want to bloom in 2019. Don’t you? 🌼 
To young people with poor body images:There’s no “just this once”There’s no “I’ll stop when I reach my goal”There’s no “This is unhealthy but it’ll make me healthier in the long run”There’s no “I can stop when I want to stop”There’s no “I’ll only restrict by a couple hundred calories”There’s no way to make yourself happy engaging in disordered eating habits. You will always want more—you will always want to be smaller, to have smaller portions, to feel more empty. Don’t trust bloggers or journalists or friends or the voices in your head that tell you this is what you need to do to be happy.Don’t make yourself do something that will take you a lifetime to recover from. Talk to someone you trust, exercise for reasonable amounts of time, eat around 2000 calories a day (even more if you exercise heavily), you NEVER need to feel shame for the things you eat. Your body is good because it is living, because it carries your soul, its shape has no effect on that goodness and worth. 
Thoughts I have to remind myself that not every day is a war. My plate isn‘t a battlefield and my body is no villain. It isn’t okay to eat unhealthy because I will eat healthy the next few days - it’s okay to eat unhealthy because I am human and I love to eat pizza. It’s okay because two bananas and three chocolate chips aren’t a binge which I have to erase with a following day of eating less. This way of living, the constant thought about what I eat and how I can reach my goal just to eat more and try it the next day again isn’t normal. It’s not healthy and I don’t deserve this. Nobody deserves this. I have to remind myself that I am allowed to relax. Not just for today but forever. It seems unreal but I am allowed to end this battle in my head just by ending it. Today, My thoughts are stopping me from letting them go- but i hope that someday I am able to leave the battlefield.  
I want to say that this isn’t me being brave, that this is just me living & it’s totally normal & I’m 100% happy and confident in this body. 
But, at this point in my journey, that just isn’t the truth. This is the scariest picture I’ve ever posted & doing so is giving me so much anxiety. I’ve tried to post tummy photos before, but they’re still all saved in my drafts &, for some crazy reason, I clicked post on this one. It only takes 5 seconds of insane courage to change anything right? Well here’s that little bit of courage. 
I think the main reason I’m posting this is because this is what I needed to see when I was growing up, & even now I still need to see this. If I grew up seeing the way people really looked, I wouldn’t have been so ashamed of my body, & I probably wouldn’t have learned to view food as such a bad thing. It’s been a long, hard, painful journey to get to this point in my life & I’ve done some serious damage to my body, but now I’m learning to love it & to take care of it.
And now I want to see all sorts of different sizes & types of people. That’s how it is in all of nature, yet somehow society decided to change it all in a blink of an eye. Take a moment & look around you. There are so many dogs, flowers, cats, trees, mountains, bodies of water, & more that all look so different, & yet we think all humans should look the same? That doesn’t make sense & that’s not how it works. So take off society’s glasses & learn to love, accept and support yourself & the people around you, no matter their size, shape or belief system, really no matter what!
I’m slowly letting myself come to the knowledge and conclusion that I’m fucking bomb as fuck and that fact has NOTHING TO DO WITH HOW I LOOK. It’s nice to look in the mirror on a day when I feel not very attractive and be like “oooo bitch you’re fuckin dope” because I’m worthy and amazing regardless of my weight, appearance, whatever! It’s been a struggle for me before to think that people will like being around me if I look like shit but honestly, if people care about my ability to look good instead of my personality, that’s their fuckin problem!!  
I may be wearing all black for work but I feel almost…content with my body today???  
I’m gonna be so happy. I’ll make lemonade and chill all day long and make some funky music bc I’m gonna be ok. I’ll take my dorky pup and even dorkier lad out camping and I’ll finally paint my lame desk. I’m also gonna make a cake every month bc as it turns out, I’m all about cake🌼 
what does the “healthiest” version of your self look like? does it include: toned “abs,” protein in everything, compulsive exercise, thin hair, forced smiles? what about: nourishment, indulgence, fitness, rest, luscious hair, true joy, balance? my healthiest self may not be my thinnest or my fittest self, but i have to believe it will be my happiest self.  
even though yesterday sucked, there was some progressi didn’t get blackout drunki didn’t go to buy more alcoholi didn’t self-harmi ate breakfast/didn’t restrict this morning to compensate 
here’s the deal, friends. we lovin ourselves in 2019. we recovering in 2019. we still losing weight but in a healthy way. im tired of hating myself, its exhausting. i encourage all of u to join me, but if u cant its okay. ily bebs. 
12/24🌱keep having to remind myself, i’m not an anorexic who’s failing, i’m a person who’s succeeding  
so i’m a part of an ED recovery group on facebook. and i mentioned in MY OWN POST, my very own personal post, (i just want to make it clear i didnt invade or side track anybody else’s post) that trans people have a higher risk of developing eating disorders, and being trans and having an ED, i wish more people would speak up and research this and be aware.and somebody had the audacity to say something along the lines of “I have many trans friends and none of them have eating disorders so i dont think this is true”.and another person was basically like, “hey, theres not that many trans people anyways so its not worth spreading awareness”and just stupid stupid arguments.i so so wish i had screenshotted before the post got taken down due to the arguing but like. i’m so so upset about this. all i gotta say is, there is no fucking harm in spreading awareness about these things. theres literally no harm. so why are you fucking derailing my post and trying to silence me????Like i literally don’t care if you think that’s more important to focus on AFAB people with EDs (most people will say “women” but statistics point to it being a biological thing, which includes all AFAB people). When you come out and say “this is more important so lets talk about this instead”, what you’re saying to me is “trans people don’t matter to me and i dont care that they’re at risk”.these people, these comments derailing my posts, are explicitly transphobic. i dont care if they claim they arent, deep down the reason theyre saying these things is because they don’t care about trans rights or awareness of trans issues. and that’s bullshit.i’m so sick of my identity being shamed on, i’m so tired of trying to speak up for my gender because NO ONE ELSE WILL and then just being shushed away.I WILL NOT BE SILENCED.TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. MY IDENTITY MATTERS. AWARENESS ABOUT MY HEALH RISKS MATTER. THESE THINGS FUCKING MATTER BECAUSE TRANS PEOPLE MATTER.anyways thanks for coming to my v aggressive TED talk. and take this as a not so friendly reminder that trans people fucking matter and need to be protected at all costs. 
I realised that I WANT to live, just not with my ED. So if I don’t want me dead, and don’t want my anorexia (fuck that bitch) so I NEED to recover. This is that simple. I want to feed my body and kill my sickness, not feed my sickness and kill my body.please reblog, if u dont want to recover, I feel bad for u, but it may help others 
honestly y’all, wholly and truly dedicating yourself to your recovery is the best decision you could ever make and don’t let your ed tell you otherwise. im so much healthier and happier now than i ever was with an ed 
I went to a party and I got a little upset because there was that very beautiful and very skinny girl and I compared myself to her and put myself down. But then I went to the bathroom and I looked into the mirror and then I thought “I don’t look like her but I look pretty cute myself”. And it made me really happy.  
anywayi am finally ready to recover and beat this ana bitch because i believe life has so much to give me that i don’t have time to stare in the mirrors and critisize my beautiful body, which is perfect, yes, i said it is fine just the way it is, like every.single.body. 
!!!!! Ya boi maintained a healthy weight for 3+ months!!! It didn’t even fluctuate by more than a tiny bit, I’m so proud. My weight kept changing by a lot very fast and we were worried about it. Gaining weight was scary but weirdly the scary part became going back down in weight sometimes, because it proved I was going back to bad habits. But I maintained a normal weight for my body and my confidence has gone up! 
Today someone offered me a piece of cake. I said yes, and without a second thought, I ate the cake.Only after did it occur to me that I have not done that in about two years since my eating disorder.I never realize how much progress I’m making in my recovery until things like this happen, especially this time.That is all. 
so I told my mom that I wanted ice cream earlier (especially since I had already eaten very little today so I was super hungry). she then went to the store and bought ice cream. I told her not to (because it’s a fear food) but she did anyway.after crying a bunch, I ate the whole little cup. granted it had a bunch of calories and it really freaked me out, I managed to make it through. I’m trying not to let the guilt sink in too much, especially since its almost 1am and I have no idea what we’re eating tomorrow but oh well. I’ll live, right? Haha well that was my little recovery win: eating Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from blue bunny 💛😊 
imagine how much nicer winter will be without restriction. How nice it will be to add sugar to your tea or drink hot cocoa on cold nights. Imagine the nights spent with friends and how much nicer it’ll be when you’re not thinking about how your body feels when they hug you. You deserve that now, no matter what your weight. 
I’m going back to college after leaving before my sophomore year. It’s been 4 years!!A lot has happened since then. And now I’m a different person. When I left school, I was severely depressed, suicidal, in the middle of an eating disorder, lost and scared. Then I slowly started to find my own way.Now I am in recovery, I’m no longer suicidal, I know what I’m capable of and I’m no longer lost. I’m louder, I speak up for myself, I fight and work hard for what I want. I don’t wish for things to happen, I make it happen. I am completely different. And I’m thankful for all of the experiences that has led me to the person I am today.I am starting another lengthy chapter in this story of my life. I’m both excited and anxious, but I’m doing it anyways. 
The HARDEST part about recovering from an eating disorder is learning to be okay with changing your body shape. Learning to be okay with gaining extra weight and having a softer face and a rounder torso takes so much effort, because you have to take time to unlearn everything that you’ve taught yourself about your image and about food, and you have to start learning how to eat for yourself again. Having an extra scoop of ice cream or that small snack you’ve been secretly looking forward to might seem miniscule to others, but I understand how important that is to those of us in recovery.I see how much effort you’re making, and I’m so proud of you  
I think im going to recovery, im so tired of hating myself  
a few months ago I couldnt even consider eating avocados and here I am now, enjoying the avocado life again♥ 
Trying to flood my dashboard with positivity rn!So please, if you post self-love and acceptance stuff and/or ED recovery, reblog or like this post so that I can follow you!I’m feeling really down and beat atm, so I just kinda need some positivity in my life 
Yes. Yes. And YESSS! I struggle with this C O N S T A N T L Y. I essentially ask my treatment team at each appointment if I reallllyyyy have a problem or if they are just listening to me ramble because it’s their job. To which, they always respond that I know the answer. That I know I am sick. That the voice in your head telling you that you aren’t sick enough is the eating disorder voice. That is not you. You are worthy of treatment and happiness and a FULL recovery and unburdened life. You wouldn’t wait until your cancer was stage 4 to treat it, so why would you need to be ANY weight to have these intrusive thoughts. We don’t assess depression by something absurd like hours spent sleeping or degree of dehydration from crying. An eating disorder is no different. I think you and I both know this, BUT the ED voice can be so so powerful we need reassurance and reminders that it is a problem because of how I feel not how I look. As for the meal plan, mine is not currently fpcused on a change in caloric amount, but a change in the timing/routine (aka still eating a meal or snack after something triggering happens). So I’m not yet experiencing the physical discomfort associated with nutritional rehabilitation… I’m stuck on working through the emotional distress of having to maintain any kind of structured plan that doesn’t take into account how I am feeling or what upsetting events might have happened. I should add, it has been 2 days since setting this out and it is already a lofty goal. I am already struggling. Some things that help are preemptively having an action plan for what I will tell myself to follow the meal plan and relaxation/distraction techniques to get through it. I also have a really hard time disobeying people so it’s hard because I don’t want to disappoint them. Like them saying I have to makes me feel like I have permission to, or like it’s not my choice to debate their plan (because it is admittedly in my best interest). So I fight like hell, cry if I have to, call a friend, but sit down and eat because letting the eating disorder win is simply just not working for me.That was long but I really really feel this. My heart goes out to you. Be gentle with yourself. Forgive yourself. It’s ok to make mistakes, just figure out what you lacked in that moment, get back on track, and try something new the next time. Keep fighting 💕 
In case you haven’t heard it today, you are doing great. You are important and you are brave and you are enough. 
A huge mocha soft serve because I love ice cream and I hate anorexia :) 
💗 please don’t be mad at your body 💗💗 it’s doing its best 💗 
I had a good recovery day yesterday in that I ate whatever, had more Oreos than I’ve ever had in a day before because I’ve been craving them for months, ordered what I wanted for dinner anyway, AND got ice cream with my (future) sisters-in-law for her birthday and ended up sticking half in the freezer because I was full and wanted to honor my hunger cues. Went to bed not hungry for the first time in months. So of course today I’m in a very bad place, but I’ll make it through.  
I don’t care how many times I have to tell myself I will not relapse. Gotta say it to believe it, I guess. 
One year and 10 lbs heavier, but so much happier and healthier  
I hope that one day we will all be betterone day every ana account will be a recovery account. every preteen and teen will be assured and cared for and protected, lead away from these disorders. We will heal and thrive and we will all get to where we are supposed to be. We will quiet the voice that tells us to starve. One day we will all be better.  
About RecoveryHey! I’m putting myself into recovery. I’ve been eating 800 calories daily this last week and my mood as increased, my love has increased, and my mindset has shifted. I can’t stand idly by and kill myself anymore. I knew I had it in me!! I’m hopeful. Please keep reading if you’re considering recovery./Here’s my story, quickly. I was depressed for all of high school. I missed my prom, I missed all my grades inside jokes, I missed friends and parties and everything. In mid 2018 I started restricting. I think July? I’ve lost a lot of weight. I lived for the next time I’d see people and they’d say hey you look great! But now I dread it. Aren’t I worth more than my weight? Why is the first thing you always say related to my appearance? I started to hate myself more than I ever did with a BMI of 32.2./Let’s not bullshit. Confidence comes with weight loss. But confidence DOES NOT equal self love. I’m gonna repeat that. /Confidence =/= Self Love/People’s priorities and needs are never the same from one’s recovery to the next. A lot of recovery posts say, hey, you deserve to eat! I personally never had the mentality that I didn’t deserve to eat. I’ve never used meanspo and I’ve never encouraged anyone else to be anorexic. My priorities were different. I starved myself because I hated myself, and I figured if I looked a certain way I wouldn’t hate myself anymore. Here’s the scoop, scoob:/Even if I liked the way I looked, I would still hate myself./And literally I don’t have the energy to like ANYTHING right now. Even with 800 calories daily I’m so gone mentally. Let’s say, theoretically, there was a correlation relationship between weight and self-love. My brain would deadass be so gone from lack of nutrition that I wouldn’t even be able to register the idea that I love myself. Please, consider that. Your brain is not working. You are not capable./I’m deleting my blog tomorrow. I want to rip the rug out from under my feet. Please, please consider recovery today. It can be scratchy and rough. It can be upping your intake to 600-2000cal daily. Who cares, it’s yours, and you can increment it however you need to./I hope you grab your love from within you and wear it on your sleeve. I hope you walk to enjoy the view instead of the effect on your body. More than anything, I hope you have the strength to say you’re more than your eating disorder. You aren’t your calories or the lies you’ve told or the food you’ve binged. You’re you, and there’s nothing more individually beautiful than the self./I want to thank @royalveinspaperplanes. Your posts and words influence me greatly. You’re amazing for all you do in the community. You’ve genuinely helped me and I hope you find your way back to recovery. Don’t be afraid to take care of yourself❤❤❤ 
Where I’m at these days. No counting, no weighing, and no dancing—and I think it needs to stay that way for a while. Thanks for the encouragement on my last text post ❤️❤️❤️ 
My eating disorder hasn’t been present in a while and I’m relieved that I can focuse on the things that make me happy. Life is tough and sometimes I want to crawl into bed an give up, but then I think about all of the things I have and will achieve and how beautiful life can be and stand back up. It’s okay to have these feelings, it’s okay to feel like your drowning. It happens. It’s all about picking yourself back up. I am an adult. My eating disorder wanted me to feel helpless and weak. Wanted me to believe that I am a burden. But I am not even though sometimes I feel like I am. I have to keep going and be the best version of myself for myself  
One of the most difficult habits to get rid of in my recovery is the constant checking of calories. I still catch myself doing it sometimes, and I need to fight against it. It just became something so natural to me, I sometimes do it without even thinking, which sucks.However, yesterday I did something I had never done before: I bought something (those frozen vegan hamburgers) and I didn’t feel the need to look at the package and check the calories. This is such a victory for me because usually I either already know the calories to something (which I’m always trying to forget) or I have almost an irresistible urge to check the package.As soon as I got home, I did what I always do (also, here’s a tip for everyone trying recovery, this helps a lot): I took the burgers out of the package and put them in a bag in the freezer. Then, I threw the package away and guess what? I still have no idea how many calories they have.I tried one today and they’re so good! I didn’t feel guilty at all eating them and, in fact, I’m very happy I decided to buy them. 
ALL BODIES ARE SUMMER BODIES 
does anyone else with/recovering from an ED ever find themselves stopping and thinking how weird it is to not eat when they are hungry? (like, I caught myself today thinking I wanted a banana and looking at the clock to see if it was time to eat and wondering if I should change what I had planned to eat and have a banana instead of the apple I was going to have with my other food- it’s so weird to have a zillion rules and overthink all of this instead of just being like, “I am hungry, I want a banana” -> *eats a banana*” 
“You’re more than flesh and bones.”—Christina Aguilera, Demi Lovato (in “Fall in Line”)  
A letter to those suffering from an ED:I know that what you are going through is tough. I know you don’t feel at home in your recovered body.⁣ Instead of focusing on how bad you feel, remember the perspectives that help you see your eating disorder will never again be able to help you. ⁣Your reward centre isn’t working as it should - that’s not your fault, but it doesn’t make eating bad, and you need to retrain your brain to recognise reward. Think about how you would feel if another sufferer successfully completed a meal. When you feel reward through something such as movement, remind yourself that that is what it should feel like when you accomplish something.⁣Restricting doesn’t make you a superhuman. It gives you an adrenaline rush that is very short lived, and overall you can get much more done if you live each day at 50%, than one day at 100% and four at 0% as a result. You are not invincible. ⁣You have value even when the things you do are not perfect. Being reliable 75% of the time is better than not being reliable at all. You don’t have to be perfect to have value. ⁣Recognising your own value is so important. Be kind to others, but never at the detriment to yourself. Do not set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You were not put on this earth to fix anyone but yourself.⁣Most importantly, you CAN get through this. I know it seems impossible, I know it feels like eating dinner every day will kill you, I know it seems like you will never love the skin you are in, but I promise you one day these things will not be the most important things in your life. The recovery train will take you to far greater places than your eating disorder could ever dream of.⁣⁣Keep fighting, because your future is so worth fighting for. 
Okay, so I think this is the meanest, most hurtful anon message I have ever received. Honestly, what you said is exactly what my eating disorder tells me every day. It tells me that my meal plan MUST be too high for me to have gained this much weight since I honestly haven’t binged in over a year and a half. But you’re wrong, and my eating disorder is wrong. I know this because the professionals who went to school for years to learn these things told me so. BMI is a totally shit measure of how healthy your weight is. Despite what my eating disorder tells me, I was underweight for me 50 pounds ago. I was, quite literally, dying. And now, I’m at a healthy weight for my body and I’m thriving. My weight restoration and recovery is just as valid as people who had an extremely low BMI and gained to a normal BMI. Because BMI is so incredibly stupid. It does not take into account family history, bone size, muscle mass, growth trends, or any of that.I hope that you get the help that you need, anon. You have some skewed perspectives about what recovery and health looks like. I really, truly hope that you are able to get treatment and are able to love yourself and carry that love over to other people, instead of sending hateful, damaging messages to people you know are in recovery from severe eating disorders. 
Just deleted ALL of my posts with thinspo or anything that could encourage mine or possibly anyone else’s eating disorder. Every time I’ve relapsed, I’ve felt stronger when I choose to recover again. The only reason this last time was so bad was because something happened that really damaged my mental health overall. But I know I can do this no matter what happens 
maybe you didn’t ever actually stop eating. maybe you still ate the same amount of food as before our horrible world corrupted your mind (which is not your fault!). maybe it just feels so painful to take a bite of anything with calories, but you still ate. but you know what? you’re still valid and you still deserve and need to follow the path to recovery. it may be a small thing in your mind right now, but it’s better to treat it now, because it’s gonna grow into a big thing. it may even be a big thing. either way, you shouldn’t have to feel like you’re undeserving of help and recovery just because some people have it worse than you!!ok to reblog 
today I was home, studying, and as soon as everyone went out, meaning I was left alone, my first thought was “HURRY UP! GO BODY CHECK! WEIGH YOURSELF! TAKE SELFIES! THE MIRROR IS ALL YOURS!” and I instantly stood up but stopped myself like “???? what are you doing, boo???? we dont do this anymore??? you can sit back now” and right then and there I realized how much time I used to spend torturing myself every single day. it was a relief to know I didnt have to go body check, that it was a choice and that I am brave enough now to choose not to do that. 
Today I was looking for recipes for food to meal prep next week and thought, I don’t need it to be low calorie, I need it to be food that sustenta me. And if that isn’t the truest thing ever.Food is goodFood is fuelFood is fuelFood is NOT the enemie, your eating disorder is 
Tomorrow, May 30th, marks my five year ED recovery date. I’m always torn between being amazed that I’ve lasted for so long, and have come so far, and the desire to give in and indulge my ED. It’s so hard. And I always feel guilty…I’m constantly fighting to stay afloat in my sea of madness. And when my BPD gets bad, all I want to do is gorge myself on food and life, and purge until my stomach is hollow and caving in. I know that I need to keep it together if I want to do well in grad school, in the fall; if I want to maintain my friendships; if I want to achieve my dreams; if I want to be healthy; and if I want to be in a healthy, romantic relationship. It’s just so hard sometimes. Too often, I feel like I have the weight of the world on my shoulders. I don’t remember the girl I was before my ED, so I’m tasked with creating someone new. I’m slowly creating myself.I want so much. I want to continue creating art and weaving stories; I want to travel the world; I want to be hopelessly infatuated with living; I want to love and be loved; I want to be in love, romantically, and treated with gentleness; I want to learn and explore; I want to eat good food.I want. I want. I want.I am. I am. I am.I’ve finally killed the girl I used to be.  
I am worth recovery even when I feel totally un-worth it 
So here’s the thing. I’m sad. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I am currently facing redundancy at work, have little money and I am extremely single and feel like I have nothing to actually recover for… 
But this girl is still not giving up. 
There are far worse places to be in, and even if an eating disorder tells me there is no point to recovery, then maybe my motivation can be to prove those thoughts wrong. 
I guess this is a bit of a sad post, but I wanted to put it out it out there as I admire so many of these amazing beautiful recovery queen’s who are aceing it and in these wonderful relationships with beautiful houses and interesting careers… But I wanted to remind myself that even though I don’t feel like I have those, and am lost in life at the moment… That doesn’t make me any less worthy of recovery. 
Hence eating this cheesecake without feeling motivation, but knowing I need to challenge myself. 
Today Sucked!!!but i’m still going to eat something, and i’m still going to wash my face and have some nice oatmeal tomorrow morningwe will try again tomorrow. and if tomorrow isn’t better, we will keep trying 💘🍓🤟 
There is NOTHING wrong with being soft. Society has tried to beat into us that everything about us should be hard, from our abs to our hearts. Of course, strength and toughness are good things to have sometimes, but that doesn’t always come naturally to everyone. So, don’t be afraid to be soft.If who you are is soft-spoken, BE THAT.If who you are is emotional and sensitive, BE THAT. If who you are includes a soft tummy, DON’T YOU DARE FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO CHANGE THAT.All of those traits are beautiful and vital to this world. YOU are vital to this world. Exactly as you are. 
Shaming someone will not make them recover. Telling someone that they are ruining your life won’t make them recover. If you want to help someone recover from an eating disorder, be supportive. And if you don’t know how, ask them how you can best support them through their recovery  
2 MONTHS!! This morning on my walk I’ve been reflecting on life 2 months ago to now. Two months ago I was in the hospital unable to walk, unable to sit without a lot of assistance, my gastrointestinal system was not working and my only stability came from a nasogastric tube with its contents being the thing keeping my body going. Oh what a difference health makes. Then I was scared for my health, today I’m grateful for it. These days I’m eating very regularly, I have more peace and hope and everyday I’m working towards my goals. It’s not a one-time decision but a daily one, and it only happens moment by moment, choice by choice. I’m grateful that my body has made the stable comeback that it has and everyday is an opportunity to look after my body and my health in the best way that I can ❤️ Posting this to remind myself how far I’ve come and why I owe to it myself to live this life in the very best way that I can 🌸 
You’re beautiful ❤️ You deserve love ❤️ You deserve to be happy ❤️ If you need anything, message me ❤️ You’re loved darling ❤️ 
Just your daily reminder to be a strong, badass feminist. ♥️ 
Breakfast.. Feeling guilty now. But I’m gonna keep fighting :) 
Recovery Plan I will start by forcing myself to have a net cal intaje of 700 calories a day, which is terrifying. Once 700 is no longer scary and I am comfortable, I will move up to 800 and then continue adjusting to higher calories until Im at 1200 a day. I will not weigh myself at all. I will continue to exercise, but the more I exercise, the more I have to eat. This is terrifying but I know it will be worth it. Also, @daydreamingofdusk really inspired me to recover. Their blog just radiates comfort and reassurance. I reccomend anyone thinking about recovery to take a look and remember whats good for them. Im so happy to be taking steps in a new direction, away from my eating disorder. I know I can do this.  
If you are recovering or want to recover from an ED, please read this.I’ve seen a lot of people on here who were in their recovery journey, and they ended up developing another eating disorder instead of truely recovering. Please do try and recover. Don’t let this scare you, but don’t forget to consult with a dietician or someone who was successful in their recovery journey or a coach or whatever… Just don’t go into it alone.First thing you need is support. If not from friends and family then from an online following. I know many anas who aren’t in recovery who would cheer you on if you are, myself included. We don’t want you to suffer, we only want to understand eachother and minimise the damage. Please do get help if you can. We want eachother to recover and be safe and happy.Second thing is order. To fight a disorder, you need order. Obviously. You need to regulate your diet. Best way to do this is to get a doctor involved. If you can’t, then someone with experience. Since you already have an ED you are prone to getting another one, it’s just how it is. So you have to prevent that from happening. It’s really easy to develop a BED while you are in recovery, or become obsessed with fitness etc… If you are still looking to lose weight while you are in recovery (because you are overweight and are afraid it would cause complications etc) please try to do so in a healthy way. If you are looking to gain it (because you are underweight) try to not do so by binging it back up, and so on. Best way to do so is by having a professional monitor your eating habits to prevent irregularities.Third thing is you need to prevent relapses. Surround yourself with positivity. Don’t let the voices tell you how you look. Listen to compliments, talk to someone about your worries. Recognise the signs of a relapse and stop it right where it is. It will not control you anymore. You are the one who controls it. Focus on your own happiness and not the ED’s happiness.And now with that in mind, good luck on your journey. 
Just Keep Breathing; for me it’s a reminder to keep going despite my depression, despite the anxiety, despite any eating disorder urges I have. It’s a reminder to slow down, because everything is going to be okay. 
Eating is hard. Recovery is hard. I’m trying to force myself to eat an appropriate amount every day, but eating anything at all still feels like too much. I wish I could just snap my fingers and have my eating disorder be gone for good 
I will never be as skinny, but I will be free.  
I haven’t purged or starved for at least a week. I’m so thankful my lovely boyfriend is being so supportive and motivating me to be healthy.  Even my mom said to me yesterday “wow your skin has color.  You don’t look so gray anymore. ”This is hard for me to not calorie count or purge or restrict but when my bf or my mom tells me how happy they are and proud they are of me for eating it makes it a little easier.  
“There is far too much out there to waste days, months, or even years trapped in the limbo state of being well enough to survive, but sick enough to be miserable.” -fighting.for.progress on Instagram—I relate to this so hard. And right now I feel myself slipping back into this limbo state. I’m sort of losing sight of recovery. I don’t know if I want it anymore; I feel too tired and distracted to even care.Today I restricted breakfast and I just felt relief. I don’t have time to be sad, anxious, or numb. With work and now returning back to school after 4 years, leaving before starting my sophomore year, I need to be focused, I need to be strong. And I guess recovery is like on the back burner. I have to be strong to fight these urges but I need to be strong in other areas of my life right now and that’s where I’m putting all of my energy.When I wasn’t in school and was working part time, recovery was my job. Now I am adding other things on my plate. And before, restricting used to be hard because I was so strong in my recovery. Now it’s easier, and that scares me.I know what I can lose if I go down this road again. But I miss the feeling of being empty. Like when I restrict I get that immediate relief and then I snap back into working hard and planning things out for school in the fall. Then I come home and feel drained, so I sit with the urge to restrict because everyone is home so I have to eat.Today I got “lucky” because no one was around for breakfast so I got away with restricting.And then lunch is hard because I eat with co-workers and I’m too tired to come up with excuses to skip lunch or to find a hiding place where I can leave for 30mins and come back and say I ate lunch.I guess that’s a good thing that there are barriers to my restricting meals. Let’s hope it stays that way… 
This is just a post to document that this morning I woke up with hope again, and faith and expectancy for the future. This week I’ve felt pretty overcome and overwhelmed by all this, but today I know I will move forward and that hope is absolutely real and I can have a beautiful future 💖🌸 
HI HERE IS ME RE-COMMITTING TO RECOVERY AFTER MY LAST RELAPSE!!! Wanted to share this successful day with you all, let’s get back up and fight to get our lives back! ♡ 
Yesterday’s snacks.. It was a lot but I told myself to relax and just let myself have some sweets ‘n stuff :)  
I WILL GET CURRY INSTEAD OF EATING A MOTHER EFFIN SALAD NOW AND ILL EAT NAAN WITH IT AND MAYBE ILL EAT ICE CREAM AS DESSERT BC HOLY FUCK I AM ALLOWED TO EAT 
im sick of this shit i want to recover  
Because I CAN trust my brain. It’s an eating disorder I can’t trust!  I can treat myself to yummy treats, and nights in doing nothing. I am allowed that. I will graduate with a degree. And I will recover.    
So I deleted my calorie counting app and downloaded this ed recovery app and omg it’s calling me out at every turn The app is called Rise Up 
Don’t listen to that monster in the back of your brain when it tells you that you don’t deserve to be happy.Because you do. You really do.So allow yourself to feel happy when good things happen to you, and tell that monster in your head to fuck off. 
I feel that I’ve been on the verge of relapse lately. The mirror checking, the constant thoughts about what and how much I’ve eaten, the ‘I’m not trying to lose weight, but I gotta watch my body’… I don’t even know where those thoughts are coming from, I’m happy, life is good!!Right now I shudder even thinking about restricting, thank God.But still, I need to be very, very careful and gentle towards myself.I. NEITHER. WANT. NOR. NEED. YOU. ANA!!  
I checked the scale again, (I know I shouldn’t have), and I’ve gained a bit of weight which I know mostly has to be water weight but it still stresses me out extremely. My mind is telling me to not eat tomorrow or wait until later when I’m at work so I’ll only eat once, but I wont do that. I need to do better, and I cant let this ruin the progress I’ve been making. I use the thought that I need to be better for my boyfriend a lot, but I also just need to be better for myself. Itll be hard, but I’ll keep going 🖤 
Just an update to say that I’m feeling the most well I’ve felt in a number of weeks. I feel healthy and I’m really really grateful for that. I’m finally medically stable and will be making the move to the mental health ward probably today or tomorrow. Really not looking to facing solid food again, but being as mindful as I can and grateful for all of the small things in front of me and all the people doing this journey with me 💜 The best is yet to come 
Recovery is terrifying (please read)Hey everyone! I haven’t posted in awhile because I’ve sorta been recovering. I’ve been eating whatever I went but I know it’s still under 1,000 calories each day. If I eat even two meals, my stomach hurts so so badly. That’s because your stomach is a muscle and I haven’t used this muscle in ahwile. That’s how eating 100 calories every day for a few months will effect you. This is scary and I don’t know if I’ll stick with it but I’m so happy. I can eat anything! The best part is that I’m maintaining my weight. Please guys, eat more, be free. You can eat more and maintain your weight. It feels so good! 
Anyway, before we can consider veganism, vegetarianism, anything-ism, or even whether a food is healthy or not, we have to feed ourselves. I repeat you have to make sure you’re consistently feeding yourself before you attempt to change your diet. Skipping food/restricting is always less healthy than eating. Yes if it’s a twinkie. You have to eat! Yes, even if that means you need to eat meat. Yes, even if you need to eat McDonald’s. You. Need. To. EAT.If you can’t feed yourself consistently, you can’t make more restricting choices about your diet without it harming you. Just eat.  
Just realized I love my face. Huh. 
There’s only one you, and that you is wonderful. If you weren’t here, the world would be missing out on something truly special ❤ 
I’m gonna win this fight 
you are worth it. 
This marks the first time I’ve worn shorts outside of my house in over two years! With the anxiety came the feeling of accomplishment, and this is a big step forward for me in accepting myself. 
Things are really hard and I’m struggling to cope in these 4 walls. BUT I do not want this to be my life. I do not want to continue to cycle in and out of hospital. I do not want to continue to live on continuous feeds because I feel incapable of facing food again. I want to live my life. I want to hold onto hope and find life and joy again. I want to walk in fresh air and go back to school and finish my degrees and spend time with my friends. There is so much more to life than this eating disorder and I refuse to let it steal the rest of my life from me. 
I ate way too little yesterday and I just couldn’t let my ED voice in my head win so I thought about it for like over an hour and then decided to just do it and buy myself really good ice cream. At first I thought I can not finish it after a few scoops and I put it back in the freezer but then after a few hours my stomach felt better and I could eat the whole pint. With the ice cream I had about  2300 calories in total then and I didn’t let Ana control my life that day :)  
Honestly I hate how girls and women are encouraged to just lose weight, to take up less space, to be weak or even sick. If you want to change your body you are supposed to restrict your food and maybe do some cardio. Fuck diets and fuck relying only on cardio! Bodyweight training, weight lifting, yoga, THOSE will get you the fastest results if you are consistent. When you restrict your body eats away at itself and you become sick and weak. When you nourish your body and build muscle those muscles will continue to burn fat for you even when you are at rest. I was taught to fall in love with watching my already thin body shrinking in on itself, I wanted to be a weak, sick, wilted flower. But now I just focus on eating mostly whole foods, colourful veggie and fruit filled dishes, and giving my body what it wants when it wants it. Now I’m in love with watching my arms swell and feeling my stomach harden. I’ve known this since I was a child in gymnastics but my body wants to build muscle, it’s always been willing to do that for me. The women on my mom’s side have always been prone to having muscular arms and I don’t care who calls them manly I love my arms and I love that they allow me to do a lot of things people wouldn’t expect me to be able to do given my size.  Women need to be told that it’s okay to build muscle, it feels amazing getting stronger instead of weaker. We were BUILT to climb and lift and move, we were designed to enjoy food. I eat way more now than I did when I was in my disordered eating phase and I’ve gained weight but it’s all muscle. All of my clothes still fit perfectly after the weight gain because I’m the same size just more toned. Gaining weight when you need to doesn’t have to be scary. My body looks better and performs better in daily life than it ever did when I was strict with my diet, and I don’t have as much fatigue slowing me down. Even after I got past my disordered eating I was prone to losing my appetite due to depression so I kept slipping back underweight without realizing and I still felt out of control. Having larger muscles to maintain means that I am far less likely to lose my appetite and I am more likely to want to eat even if I don’t feel like it because I like my muscles and I want to nourish them instead of leaving my body to eat away at them in desperation. It’s okay to have visible muscle tone, it’s okay to take up space, it’s okay to give your body the sustenance it needs to be healthy. Your body wants to get stronger to make your daily life easier. Your body is not your enemy .  
I AM GOING TO RECOVER ITS GOING TO BE LONG AND HARD BUT I WILL, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS EVER HAPPENS TO ME 
Im going into recovery.. I think.. at least I'gonna try. I told my parents about everything and their reaction was better than I expected. They are very supportive. Im getting out it this dark place that Ive been in for two years. Im ready to live again. I hope the best for you all. Truly.

Things you can enjoy if you recover:-fast food-friends-parties-family dinners-traveling -sex-Christmas -birthdays-exercise -sleeping in-clubbing-cold weather -buying clothes -relationships-baking -your mom’s cooking -health-life Things you can enjoy if you keep your eating disorder:-a false sense of control-momentary euphoria after seeing the number in the scale drop-momentary relief after a purge  
having body fat is human and shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of or insecure about ❤️ 
Thank you to everyone for all the kind messages, you’re all making recovery that much easier  
This feels like it should be so obvious, but I see bona fide recovery bloggers who are guilty of this attitude. Making compromises with your ED is not recovery. It can be a first step forward, but if you consider yourself to be out of the woods in terms of recovery, talk about “rarely” dealing with disordered thoughts, but are still only holding off on disordered behaviors because you want to be “slim thick,” “slim and strong!” or other codes for “skinny but, like, in a way I consider healthy,” your disorder still has a foothold. Many of us who’ve lost a significant amount of weight due to our disorder will gain it all back. Some will gain even more. This is literally healthy. Recovery from restrictive EDs always involves some gaining because your body is going to hoard nutrients when you first start properly feeding it. Even for those recovering from binge eating disorders, letting go of the obsession with weight and size is an important part of moving past the feelings which create the urge to binge.TL;DR: The urge to control the path of your recovery will always get in your way. Recovery isn’t a new form of control, it’s embracing your body without feeling the need to control it. It is exercising because it feels good, eating because it tastes good, living in the moment, and trusting your body. Not trusting it to stay skinny. Trusting it to do its job of helping you live. 
I’m also talking to my body a lot. She tells me a lot of confusing things, but that’s because I don’t speak her language anymore. But we’re talking. 
She loves me, and I want to love her. And I’m trying.  
Where I’ve been Early 2019: Grunge, dark aesthetic, drinking too much, drugs, hardcore relapse, sad, lethargic, jaded, hot headed, not taking care of myself, no check on mental health, brooding. Where I’m trying to be for the rest of 2019: flowy sun dresses, light aesthetic, soft, optimistic, happy thoughts, battling my depression and anxiety and staying strong, slowly recovering from my eating disorder, doing my best for my mental health, being energetic, smiling through it all, letting myself feel for a while and then moving on and pucking myself up.I’m really going to recover and do my best to be positive and confident and all of you are welcome to watch! If you post thinspo or anything triggering, you can still follow me but I wont be following back. If you post recovery things, I will be following back. I am going to bloom and it will be beautiful 
today I had the chance to skip lunch but stopped studying, went out to buy some groceries then proceeded to cook me a nutritious & delicious meal because a) I was hungry and b) need food regardless so!! I even got dessert so who’s winning♥  
When the morning sadness stretches over my room, I long to find words that describe where my mind is taking me. My cup of tea is always half empty and I keep reminding myself that I need to put the kettle on the stove again. Poetry is beautiful until your fingers start bleeding because you’ve been writing nonsense for hours. I look back on a different life survived last year by a girl who was too afraid to live. I don’t wish for that numbness anymore. I don’t wish for the world to be afraid of me because the silence between us would be unbearable. They have let me down before but I haven’t been the best version of me either. When I stir  my coffee tomorrow morning, I’ll realize I was brave enough to add milk this time. Maybe I don’t need poetry to prove I am all about ups and downs. I am living proof. the recovery stories. (V.B) 
tw ednow when I see pictures of how I looked when I deprived myself from so much, it just pains me. I did not realize I looked miserably unhealthy. I’m so glad I recovered and I never think about doing horrible things to myself again. I overcame that.  
Taking recovery seriously tonight. The 8 keys to recovery from an eating disorder workbook is new and just picked it up tonight :)  
ReflectionSo I have just finished my first year of college. Currently, I’m struggling a little bit, but I wanted to take some time to reflect on how far I really have come. 2 years ago, I didn’t think I’d make it. I was so wrapped up in my ED that it was all I cared about. And then the summer of 2017 changed my life when I went inpatient. I started my senior year of high school just a few days after I got home from treatment. But that school year was different from all my others. I had a voice I never knew I had. I made friends and got an amazing boyfriend. Then college came. Some days were rough, but to be honest, I love my school. I have earned opportunities I would have never imagined for myself, and I feel like a part of the community for once. Next semester I will start my job as a Resident Assistant, something I’m super excited for. I have many more things planned as well. So maybe I’m struggling a little right now, but I have overcome so much, and I truly cant wait to see what the future holds. Recovery is worth it. 
Second- every person living with an eating disorder has real emotions, real lives, real heartbreaking moments in their past, and real goals that they are trying to achieve. Every human is valid and worthy of love and support. Each and every one of us. Leave the hate behind. If you can’t say something nice- get out. 
recovery from an ED is baby stepsMore words from my therapist!! For all of you wanting a way out of, or help starting recovery from an ED(anorexia in this case)This is kind of a short one, a single-tip post, but important nonetheless!!Recovery isn’t immediate. You don’t start eating or stop feeling urging to restrict just magically. Even if you aren’t currently restricting due to lapses and relapses and the way those work; you can’t magically stop relapsing either.So here’s what my therapist gave me about that: When you feel an urge to restrict or a relapse coming back, obviously it is ideal you fight the relapse and don’t restrict. But since it can often be inevitable, try upping your restrictions just a little every time. Restricting 300? Try 500. Next time you relapse, now that you’ve gotten cozy at 500? Do 600 or 700. Even if it takes a few months or even a year, your ‘restricting’ can be reduced to 1000 calories. Then from there, or even during this process, you can work on other things, as this is just one facet method of recovery out of the whole process.I myseld don’t plan to recover soon, but for those who do or are, this one is for y’all!! <33 
i feel terrible bc ive been in recovery from an eating disorder for about 9 years and i’m still suffering permanent health consequences and its my fault and would have been 100% prevented if didnt go through that as a teen  
went to veg fest today! it’s crazy to think how much easier it is for me to eat food now than it was just a few months ago. i feel proud of myself for how far i’ve come, im leagues healthier now than i was this time last year. it’s kind of crazy 
Th*nspo blogs are following me which is really upsetting, but it y’all want to see my blog and my posts get ready to see some real body positivity. Ed recovery is worth it. 
body positivity time babeyI just looked in a mirror for a solid minute without feeling self hatred!!I came at the whole thing with an attitude I had heard of: “if I were to see another woman who looked exactly like me, would I think these things about her?” of course not. and I didn’t!!!!! I had to kind of step out of myself for a bit to do it, but this is actually a huge goal for me :)))))  
baby steps…. and baby leaps… and baby jumpsMission accomplished: stop the downward spiral. I’ve decided recovery is kind of like being a superhero or a spy (which I’ve decided is a nerdy/tech version of a superhero). Hear me out: all of these new coping mechanisms are kind of like spy gear. Especially initially, they work really well. Eventually, I will need more tools, more help, more support, but for now I am celebrating the fact that ‘hey I tried something’ and ‘hey it actually worked?!’ Small changes in my journaling helped me process my thoughts and make the biggest leaps  *10 full notebook sheets later* What exactly did I do? 1st. Working TREMENDOUSLY to separate the Ed-voice and Ed-self from my Healthy-voice and Healthy-self. This took some time. I have struggled with this for possibly years and remained stuck, unable to identify any real “healthy self” outside of running. 2nd. Journal the exact event or scenario triggering me. 3rd. Identify the ED-voice and it’s response to said scenario. 4th. Identify the healthy-voice and challenge the ED-voice. 5th. Identify a healthy alternative to said scenario.6th. Enact the healthy alternative. Now, this is 90% of my journaling. Identifying the thought, challenging it, offering a better alternative. VOILAA 
Stop listening to your ED thoughts and posting them on the fucking internet. That’s not “venting”, that’s dwelling. That’s giving power to your disordered thoughts. It’s not helping anyone. You should be challenging those thoughts and replacing them with productive ones. Don’t let your ED thoughts win and do NOT share them online to bring other people down. 
I will tell myself that life is beautiful until I believe it  
Fun recovery fact guys:When you eat more you actually have energy ?? My friends have said that I’ve been so much more bubbly and fun to be around now that I actually have energy to be more than an ana-consumed blob  
i know that exam times are hard for me…and for everyone else who struggles with mental illness…the addition of academic stress (especially for a perfectionist) is NOT helpful to the recovery process. so for anyone who is struggling right now and feels alone, I AM HERE FOR YOU. please PLEASE message me if you need or want to talk to someone who is also in that boat. i would love to talk to you! <3 truly. it could be good for the both of us :) 
Definitely one of the most difficult aspects of anorexia recovery. Currently feeling (and looking) like I’m 5 months pregnant, but I’m determined to keep feeding this body that has been with me through so much  
I wish I had a friend who understood what it was like growing up with an eating disorder and how it’s still affecting me to this day. I’m struggling so much with my body image rn and I could just use someone to lean on who won’t judge me for the thoughts I keep having. (Recovery talk only, I’m not interested in glorifying illness).  
now that i’m recovered from anorexia i’m like what was the point of having an eating disorder in the first place if i’m gonna gain all the weight back and more in order to recover lol just dont ever restrict bros go to therapy 
It’s Mental Health Awareness Month and it’s one of those days where I need to feel motivated to continue my recovery process. It’s the first time I am posting pictures where the before and after is the opposite of what I would have posted two years ago.
One year between the two pictures but you can tell which one is happier, healthier, full of glow and love, and recovered from the deadly anorexia that consumed me and robbed me of life.
To anyone recovering, it is worth it. The thing I am most happy about since recovering is the ability to love tenderly, something I had forgotten was possible. I am so grateful I can love. 
RecoveryJust deleted the post with the most notes on my whole blog, because it was thinspo and eating disorder related and I wanna fully commit to recovery If you were following me for ed-motivation-purpose, then feel free to unfollow. I wanna promote healthy living and will share my journey of starting to accept myself, dealing with studies and conquering my mental disorders.Please be kind 
‘Frail’It’s a word I’ve just seen to describe someone my age with anorexia. I haven’t been described as that, but is that a word I want to be associated with? Frailty is something I associate with grandparents, heck, not my grandparents but great-grandparents. With people with bone conditions, elderly people who’ve lived wholesome lives and have their families around them to care for them.Not someone who is 24.Not someone who had never stepped in a doctors (aside from skin conditions) before anorexia.Strong, is what I’d like to be described as. Happy, is another. Carefree. Smiley. Full of life. Glowing. Bright. Courageous. Joyous. Fun. Headstrong.Those are words I would much rather be associated with.Not frail. Not weak. Not struggling. Not stagnant. Not ill. 
The day that I accept my wide bone structure is the day I truly recover.Will that ever happen? Stay tuned :“)) 
I’m such a snack today 😘 
I wish I could tell my younger self that all of the things that my eating disorder promised me were all lies and that it was only through recovery that I actually got all of them 
Weight Restoration To all of you recovering from an eating disorder out there that are at a “healthy weight” or are weight restored and are still struggling, I see you. This stuff’s hard, and I personally think it’s even harder to accept yourself after weight restoration. Keep on going everybody. I’m proud of you. If you ever want to talk, I’m here for you. 
Today is a new day. Recommitting to recovery today.  
To myself:I want to make a commitment to you.I have spent almost a decade now trying to prove I love you. Fighting my brain as it spews out reasons I shouldn’t. Trying to eat and keep it down. Trying to keep the lit cigarettes and razors away from your skin. Trying to reassure you that the touch on your flesh of those you didn’t want does not define you and isn’t your fault. I have promised a million times that I will take better care of you and put you first, that I will value you and listen to you, that I will keep you safe, that I will love you.And I have failed. I can’t begin to count all the ways that I failed. I spend my days begging for people to love me. I waste hours on dating apps, and I let people treat you wrong. I let people sexualize you even when it makes your skin crawl. I let people lie to you. And use you. And manipulate you. I don’t stand up to them. I don’t stand up for you.I spend all my time on other people, desperate for them to distract me from you. I don’t want to hear about what hurts your heart. I don’t listen to how you need to heal. I keep you at bay. I ignore your needs. I neglect you.I stare at your reflection in the mirror, poking at the places that are too big, sucking in, pulling skin. You are never good enough for me. Even when you were skin and bones you were still not good enough. I treat you as half a person. I tell you that you are broken as long as you’re alone, that you need someone to fix you. I spend all my energy looking for that someone. Instead of spending it on you.I want to change that. I want to make a commitment to you.I deleted all of the dating apps today because I want to focus on you now. I want to listen to you when you feel unsafe. I want to listen to you when your heart hurts. You are not half a person. You are whole. I will treat you as a whole. You do not need someone to fix you. You just need to be loved. By me.I will love you. I want to keep my promises. Please let me try again.I will love you. 
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨ 
felt really really good in my recovery for a hot second, all of a sudden I feel huge and disgusting OBVIOUSLY after a bad day… it’s so obvious that this sickness manifests itself from deeper issues than hating your body. I guess it’s good now that I can recognize that. I will not relapse, not now, not ever. 
If you’re in recovery from an eating disorder or any other mental illness and your parents aren’t supportive then I’m your new parent now. Make sure you’ve eaten and you get enough sleep! I love you champ, you’re doing great 
Lovelies 💕❤️🐥The “deserves to love and nourish themselves” is stored in the you ❤️💕 
You deserve love. You deserve good energy. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you. You deserve to love who you are. You deserve to be at peace. 
Listen to me You are allowed to eat. You are allowed to drink.You are allowed to rest.You are allowed to take a break.You are allowed to treat yourself.You are allowed to say no.You are allowed to put yourself first 
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
things to remember:- there is nothing shameful about being hungry (even when your mind tells you you “shouldn’t” be)- there is nothing shameful about listening to your body (even if it feels like you are doing something wrong)- do not compare what your body needs to what other people are eating, they are not you - you always have permission to eat more 
You are allowed to feel sadness without taking it out on your body.You are allowed to feel guilt without attacking yourself.You are allowed to feel insecure without taking compensatory measures.You are allowed to feel.You are allowed.  
when your life means more than the size of your body I promise your whole world is going to change 
Your eating disorder will never willingly let you go. It’s never going to say to you one day, “Okay that was fun while it lasted. I’m done here!!” It just wont. You are its oxygen, the fuel to its fire, its home. It feeds off of your self-destruction, your vulnerability, your logical self. You could be seconds from dropping dead and it will still tell you, you are not sick enough. It’s not a diet, a fad, or a trial period. It’s a life-threatening mental illness with one intention: to kill you. Believe me, you are sick enough. But you are also strong enough to beat it. 
If you’re reading this, this is a gentle reminder that you are enough – as is, right now.  
The middle of recovery is awful. It does not feel good. There are moments where it will be clear why you are doing this, ones that will take your breath away. But a majority of the time you will question everything, your thoughts will be racing so much that you will feel like you can’t breathe. You will spend countless days wondering why things can’t be quiet, wondering why you are bothering to work so hard when not fighting would be effortless. Recovery does not feel good. If you are looking around you and are ashamed because you are not in love with this process, please, listen to me. Take a deep breath- It’s okay. It’s okay to hate it. It’s okay to say it sucks. It’s okay to want to give up, to struggle immensely, to be angry, to be uncomfortable (you should be!). and it’s okay to not understand why your smile still feels empty when your stomach is full again. Recovery does not feel good. For goodness sake, I hate it!!! Do not mistake my positivity for perfection. I am not walking through this fire gracefully. I burn and fall and become ashes. And every morning I rise and face the flames over and over again. So please, do not beat yourself up if you are feeling like a failure for not being happy and perfect. Healing is not linear. And you are still brave.  
What aboutWhat about when recovery isn’t smoothie bowls and organic vegan bars and protein cookies? What about when recovery is about trying to eat whatever’s in the fridge because you can’t afford all that? What about when recovery isn’t supportive family members visiting you in hospital and crying with you? What about when recovery is accepting that just because they blame you, it doesn’t mean it’s your fault? What about when recovery isn’t collapsing and being rushed to hospital to be tube fed? What about when recovery is functioning on the outside and learning to deal with ‘you don’t look ill’?You are the one who is ill. You are the one who is recovering. It does not have to look the same as someone else.  
don’t let the complexity of life drive you back to the simplicity of being ill  
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
get rid of the idea that recovery = fat recovery is energy to engage in what makes your heart sing recovery is better skin and stronger hairrecovery is taking opportunities head on recovery is being able to feel warm again recovery is the ability to sleep through the night recovery is being able to concentrate enough to read your favourite novel or sit through your favourite film recovery is birthday cake recovery is having the freedom to live life in colour rather than by a number in your head  
Fun fact: restricting does not solve your problems 
How I started It started as a diet, because I wanted a “bikini body ”.It started as a coping mechanism, to cope with my depression. It started as a way of expressing outwardly my inner pain my parents chose to ignore. It started when my dad pinched my stomach fat and laughed. It started as an obsession, to be perfect in every way. It started as a way of killing myself, without the immediate effect of dying .It started as a way of self harm ,but without the permanent scars. It started as a punishment for my parents’ abusive behaviour. It started as a result of another illness. It started when I couldn’t afford food anymore. It started when my anorexic friends pushed me to be like them. It started after I was sexually abused.It started because I wanted her to stay. It started because I lost appetite and pleasure for anything I used to enjoy.It started when I wanted to be a model. It started when I came across a proana site. It started after I stopped feeling lonely. It started when I began chemotherapy. It started when the skinny girls in my class began to attract those senior guys.It started because I wanted to fit in those size XS jeans again. It started because my mother started too. It started because it was a cry for help. It started, because I have it in my genes. It started because I believed skinny girls to be happier. It started because I wasn’t sick enough. It started because I have OCD. it started because of my gender dysphoria. It started when I couldn’t cope with his death any longer. It started because my doctor called me fat. It started because I wanted to lose weight fast.It started because no other diet seemed to work.It started when living was terribly painful and didn’t want to live any longer. It started when I was ashamed of myself just for existing and breathing made me feel guilty enough, to the point where I couldn’t stop thinking about suicide. I just wanted to disappear and scare everyone away. I started as a result of another ed. Every reason is bad enough for you to recover and you’ll always deserve to be helped, to be loved and to me validated :)Your struggles matter.  
you’re beautiful you’re loved you’re needed you’re alive for a reason you’re stronger than you think you’re gonna get through this i’m glad you’re alive don’t give up 
Recovery feels strange because for so long you got used to the loudness. The presence of the intense pain was almost something you could rely on to be there when everything else was so uncertain. The pain was in itself a coping mechanism. Do this so you don’t have to deal with that. Everyone always says it gets better. But the truth is sometimes your situation doesn’t change, you do. And so when the pain begins to ease there’s a quiet that is so difficult to become accustomed to. And yet you know this is what you need, it is what you must try and fall in love with to replace your mind’s attraction to destruction. You must come round to the fact that life is at times mind numbingly boring, it is at times exhilarating and yet you must keep faith that one day life will be more appealing than illness. 
Eating is 100% okay. We need to eat to live. We need calories for energy. And sometimes, eating makes us happy. So eat today. Eat for you!🌈💞💟 
The hardest thing to hear when you’re weight restored from an eating disorder is, “oh, so you’re cured now?”It always fills us with an odd feeling. The feeling that our emotions and thoughts are no longer valid as we are no longer underweight. But, I just wanted to remind you that:You can still have an eating disorder if you’re at a healthy weight or if you are overweight.Your thoughts are valid.It is okay to express how you are feeling.You are such a wonderful person, who has fought so damn hard to get to where you are now, don’t let any comments take that away from you. 
you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body you should not feel guilty for nourishing your body  
I’m sick of veganism + routine workouts being the common standard for ed recovery. if my recovery means lying in bed eating sweets and chips and “bad foods” (which they are not), then that’s my recovery. it’s not unhealthy compared to the vegans and vegetarians and athletes, it’s healthy because it’s what I find works best for me. end of story 
since it’s national eating disorder awareness week, here’s a picture of me that’s pretty recent. i may not be super toned or have abs anymore like i did at this time last year, but i’m also not eating less than 1200 calories a day and overexercising like i was last year. this is me. this is my body. it’s healthy. last year when i looked “fit”, i wasn’t. my body was so malnourished that after i got home from college i didn’t even have the energy to get out of bed anymore, let alone work out. i was 110 lbs and still thought i was fat. i wasn’t even able to get my period for several months because i wasn’t feeding and treating my body properly. so this is me, healthy. how much do i weigh? i have no idea, and i don’t care. i’m happy with my body and my stomach (which was the place i used to hate the most on my body) but my stomach is cute and it’s rolls when i sit down are cute and i don’t care if i don’t fit into society’s rules of “skinny” or whatever. i’m healthy, and that’s good enough for me 
I saw a tumblr post talking about how there’s no stupid reason not to act on suicidal urges, and I realized that the same is true for ED recovery.There is no dumb reason not to act on behaviors.JUST cleaned the bathroom and don’t want to get it gross again? Perfect.Can’t go running because all your shorts are in the laundry? Awesome.Have to eat lunch because you’re out with a friend and don’t want to be awkward? Fantastic.“Fine I’ll follow this dumb meal plan but only because I don’t have the time to go back into residential”? Beautiful.If it’s the small stuff that keeps you from lapsing, so what? You don’t have to love your body and be completely urge-free to still actively work recovery.One day your reasoning might look like “I’m doing this for my family” or “I’m doing this so I can keep my job,” and eventually there could even come a time when you can say “I’m doing this for me, because I deserve better.”Even if you don’t get there right away, those thoughts that might feel like dumb excuses can keep saving your life until you can. 
friendly reminder that you’re never going to look back on your life when you’re 80 years old and wish you had spent more time counting calories and less time living  
EAT WHAT YOU WANT, WEAR WHAT YOU WANT, KISS WHO YOU WANT 
Becoming less of yourself will not heal the parts of you that hurt 
That food is simply a conglomeration of energy and nutrients that help power your cells which keep you breathing and thinking and movingThat calories have no moral valueThat weight is an arbitrary measure of your relationship to Earth’s gravitational pull and in the scope of the universe the difference between Earth’s gravitational pull on any given human compared to any other human is infinitesimally insignificantThat the mirror will lie to youThat you are not a bad person for taking care of yourself or nourishing yourself or addressing your needs or taking up space 
I feel guilt, but I am not guiltyI feel disgust, but I am not disgustingI feel regret, but I have no reason to be regretful I feel anxiety, but I do not need to be anxious - Tabitha Farrar, from Rehabilitate, Rewire, Recover! Anorexia recovery for the determined adult  
Your eating disorder is a terrible translator. ‘I’m a size 10′ is translated into ‘I’m worth less than those who are a size 8 or 6 and should be a size smaller’; this is wrong. What it really mean is ‘I’m a size 10.’‘I ate pizza’ quickly becomes ‘I’ve eaten 735 calories of carbs and fats and I need to exercise and purge and fast tomorrow’; once again, ‘I ate pizza’ simply means ‘I ate pizza’. ‘I gained weight’ seems to mean ‘I am lazy and should be ashamed of myself, I am fat and a fake’; the reality is, it just means ‘I gained weight’.‘My BMI is healthy’ turns into ‘I don’t have an eating disorder and need to lose weight to prove I’m sick’; as you can guess, this phrase still only means ‘My BMI is healthy’.Don’t listen to these shitty translations because they are wrong. The phrases don’t need to be translated, they are factual and mean nothing more than they appear to. 
One day you’re going to fight off the urge to relapse and it will be the last time you ever have to again, because you will be recovered.And I think that’s worth fighting for. 
There is joy in just being 
Happy ThanksgivingYou are allowed to enjoy your food, to eat according to your preferences, to eat to the point of satisfactionYou deserve to enjoy this holiday, however that may look to you (NOT to your ED, or judgmental/unkind relatives)You can eat thanksgiving dinner AND eat breakfast and lunch and snacksYou can eat thanksgiving dinner AND all your meals AND not compensate for it before/after the holidayIt is also okay to struggle with this day and have negative emotions….remember you’re not alone in that. We’re all in this together.If the people around you make harmful comments about food/dieting/eating/anything tbh….It is not meant for you. It does not apply to you. Imagine you’re in a bubble/force field/etc and let those comments bounce right off. You have overcome so much and are so strong and you can get through these painful moments.I’m thankful for all of my followers and for everyone who is here, reading this, despite the difficult battles they are fighting. I’m thankful that you continue to fight <3 
YOU DON’T NEED AN EXCUSE TO EAT 
shame.shame is powerful. as an affective neuroscience researcher, i have studied it intensely. unlike many emotions, we are not born with it. shame is taught.i have felt shame over and over in my life. almost all of it has been shame about who i am - a nerd, an athlete, someone who loves reading books more than going to parties, a teacher, a mental health advocate. and it’s time for me to be honest.my eating disorder taught me to be ashamed over food. it taught me that there is shame in eating the foods i love - bread, cupcakes, pasta, peanut butter. it taught me there is shame in eating as much as i want - where a bagel is not a meal, but a snack for me. that i often eat more than 6 times a day. that i love processed foods just as much as any other food, that even though i’m a runner, i don’t want to be constantly focused on what is nutrient-dense and what isn’t.  that i love appetizers and eating the whole meal after, that an english muffin with jam would never hold me over in a million years.this shame has kept me trapped. it has kept me from honoring my body, from fully recovering, from honoring myself. and i’m done. i am so done. i don’t want to be ashamed anymore. it’s time for me to embrace not just food freedom, but total freedom in being myself. and i’ll probably gain weight. i might gain a lot of weight. i might gain only a little. but i’m losing the shame.so here’s to food, all food, to my body, to myself, and expect me to be posting a lot more pictures with all sorts of food because it’s time for me to be proud.  
we will all be okay 
i just really hope that the impact I have on this world is so positive and kind that nobody will have any idea about what I’ve been through. i want that to be my life. To create unparalleled warmth despite the amount of times this world tried to harden my heart and steal my smile 
you know what!!!! i wasn’t born to be skinny!!!!! my body wasn’t meant to be skinny!!!! and that doesn’t mean my body isn’t beautiful!!!!!  
That false sense of accomplishment when you’re underweight due to anorexia will never compare  to the feelings of comfort, safety, and fulfillment when you’ve recovered and can finally fall asleep at night knowing you’ve nourished your body to the best of your ability and given yourself the most love you possibly could. 
their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  
Things that define me:My passions My interests My hobbies My courage My dreams My attitude Things that DON’T define me:My face My body My weight My height The amount of food I ate today 
stop listening to serving sizes and start listening to your body  
Recovery. Is. Not. Linear. Just a friendly reminder that it is okay to take one step forward and two steps back. Be kind to yourself - your mind and body will thank you. 
You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 
You deserve to travel to another country you’ve always dreamed of visiting. To walk the streets, sipping on a pleasant drink unfamiliar to someone of your culture. To stop for a mid morning and afternoon snack, not because you’re necessarily hungry, but because you see a fantastic baked good in the café window that would bring a smile to your face and please your tourist body and mind. You deserve to sit down for a reservation at a restaurant that appears at the top of the list of best places to eat in that country. To start the meal with a thick slice of their locally baked bread with a slab of butter on top. To order a local favorite you’ve never tried before. To drizzle an unusual but intriguing sauce on top that the waiter swears is to die for. To have the waiter persuade you into taking a local favorite dessert back to your hotel room. To sit in the hotel loveseat facing the window view and eat it slowly, taking in the city. You deserve to travel without an eating disorder. You deserve to live without an eating disorder, and experience every joy life has to offer.  
I’m done denying myself life and happiness because of trying to be something I’m not. I’m a broad-shouldered, big hands and feet northern woman with a big bone-frame, and I’m finally proud to say that… that it’s okey. I’m not and never will be super tiny and light because I wasn’t built that way. I’ve finally come to accept that. 
Look at my plump cheeks, chest and arms in the second close up. I look happy! And I AM! I can actually eat delicious food again (I love bread), and have energy for drawing and studying and hiking and playing the piano and ALL the things I like, because I did.not.give.up. I faced my fears HEAD ON and now I’ve figured out that I’m freaking invincible, because I could the ONE THING I was most afraid of in the e tire world. 
So my message to you all is this: I want you to take a good, hard look in the mirror and reconsider not taking that piece of cake and or that extra serving of dinner. You can’t fix your problems this way. You can’t just focus on starving yourself or working out 24/7 because it’s madness and wasting away your life. You can’t starve away how your bones where built. Let your body be what it’s supposed to be, and try accepting it for it’s flaws
I’m still struggling with it, but I am never gonna give up trying, every single day. This is anti “thinspo”. I want none of you to go through the hell I’ve been through., waste a decade of your life over shit like this. It doesn’t just go away over night, if you get an ed you will suffer the consequences of that illness for life. I still have no idea how to eat correctly, how much or even what to eat. Please don’t destroy yourself. Be good to your body because it’s the only one you’ve got, and it needs you so desperately to keep it healthy and good. You are so worth it. If I can do this, so can you! Now go fight, be brave and let yourself LIVE!  
self-care is not selfish! (not my drawing, tell me if you know the author!) 
I have spent most of today in my pyjamas. No, I haven’t been for a run in Nike leggings or taken a photo of my beautiful overnight oats with 40 different organic toppings…because my friends….for most people, that is not recovery. Instead, I have eaten when I was hungry. I have had biscuits and toast and chocolate and fruit and a doughnut for good measure. I have had normal portions of hospital food and also a whole bar of chocolate so to be honest I am feeling pretty gross. No, I haven’t been taking photos of every meal or singing about my battle, instead I have eaten in private most of the time and with shame. But this is the start of recovery to me, not ‘clean eating’ or ‘raw til bloody 4′, it is ENJOYING food despite the guilt, despite the urge to purge. So honey, if you’re trying to recover and are put off by photos of ‘weight restored but still a size 0′ or little miss ‘recovered and only eating organic vegetables picked by japanese virgins’ then IGNORE THEM. If that feels right to YOU and not your ED, try it. If you need to lie in bed eating chocolate and toast YOU DO THAT!!! Reactive eating is scary and feels out of control but it is what it is - REACTIVE - to what your eating disorder has done to you. Your body wants to be healthy, you need to trust it. Good luck recovery bitches xxx 

You can put in your bio that you’re “not pro-ED” or whatever. But when it comes down to it, if you are putting “GW / UGW” along with unhealthy weights in your bio, or reblogging posts and tagging them “#thinspo”, or asking for “meanspo” messages in your inbox, or searching for an “ana/mia buddy”, etc., etc…..YOU!! ARE!! PROMOTING!! EATING DISORDERS!!!! End of story. 

Eating is a necessity, not a privilege. Love and care for yourself. @madsrecovers 

- You’re always tired. I’m not even exaggerating, every day by like 9 or 10pm I’m already dying. I wasn’t a nap person, but now some days I just can’t go through the day without one. Getting out of bed is difficult and moving around is exhausting. - On that note, all of those posts saying “can’t wait to be thin so that I’m not always out of breath when I climb up a flight of stairs” are utter bullshit. If anything, you’ll be struggling to catch your breath even more than before.- Chest pains. I’ve always thought the other people in this community were exaggerating and that it would never happen to me, but it’s true. Sometimes your heart seems like it’s about to jump out of your chest and you’re not even doing anything. - Your skin gets dull, your nails get brittle and your hair falls off. I think a lot of people know about this one, but it’s still worth mentioning. It is real and it fucking sucks. It doesn’t matter how much conditioner you put or how much lotion you apply, the only solution to this is eating more.- If you purge (as in, throwing up, I know there are other ways of purging), your teeth WILL rot and your mouth WILL be ruined eventually. I’ve never purged, but I know of people who have and their entire mouth and throat area are horrible now. Especially if you sing, purging will destroy your vocal cords and you’ll lose your beautiful voice.- It’s never enough. No matter how much you restrict, how much you lose, how much you work out, it’ll never be enough. This is why this illness kills, people. You’ll just keep lowering your GW and eventually you’ll be a walking skeleton, and trust me, that’s not a beautiful sight, like many people believe.- You lie. So much. You get so used to lying that you automatically say stuff like “I’m not hungry” or “I’ve eaten already”. You lie to everyone, compulsively.- You’re lonely. You cancel plans because they involve food, or because you need to exercise. Eventually, your friends will just think you’re not interested and stop asking. It’s heartbreaking.- Your life is a constant math problem. “If I eat x amount of calories now, and exercise for y minutes later, how many calories are still in my budget? Should I really have that 50 calorie apple if I know I won’t have the time to burn it off later?”. You can’t stop thinking about all the food you’ve eaten, all the exercise you need to do later, calories, calories, calories. You’re obsessed.I wanted to make this post to remind people that this illness is not pretty. It’s not desirable, it’s not a fast way of losing a few extra pounds. It kills. I didn’t even list all of the bad things that come with this illness, because there’s just so many. Literally, everything about ED’s is bad.So, please, if you can, seek recovery. If you’re new in this community, delete your account, stay away from this hellhole and don’t look back. Trust me, your life is so much better when you don’t have this stupid illness holding you back.  

Being healthy isn’t about eating nothing but salads, fruits, veggies, etc. It’s about those days where you decide to say “screw it” and eat pizza, french fries, chocolate, etc, and then the next day decide to eat a bit better. It’s not depriving your body of what it needs, as well as what you want, but having balance.﻿

If you are posting pictures of extremely underweight bodies, sharing tips on how to get skinny and how to “savely starve,” you are a proana blog.It’s not your “safe space.” If you want to do all of this in a “safe space,” make your blog private.If you are reblogging things about how to eat as little as possible, you are promoting dangerous and disordered eating. The mental gymnastics I see on here are ridiculous. 

bodies are to be moved, loved, twisted and turned, tasted, played, danced, dressed, undressed, taken care of and all the good stuff… not be ashamed, blamed, complained about or isolated from life. whatever time this is for you, use your vessel for life, for good, uplift others, be positive. you matter so much right now. let it show however.

“Mind of an anorexic, body of a failure.” My experience. (trigger warning) I began spiraling into an eating disorder at 10 years old. I have been on this “journey” for almost 8 years. I have been underweight, I have been overweight.I am now nearly 18 years old. Despite being in treatment multiple times, My eating disorder is at the worst it has ever been. I have been put down by my insurance as an “emergency case.” I will be going back into treatment on my 18th birthday. And despite losing 55 pounds, my BMI is still classified as “obese.” I am sick. I am very sick. Mentally and physically. I am diagnosed with Extreme Bulimia Nervosa. I binge and purge up to eight times a day, restrict heavily, or go a week at a time with no food whatsoever. I have a fear of absorbing calories. I drink water obsessively, weigh even more obsessively.My hair is falling out. I have an electrolyte imbalance, irregular heartbeat, and potential kidney failure. My gum line has receded so far, that I am in awe that I still have teeth. I have significantly delayed digestion, as well as other gastrointestinal issues. I cannot digest food the way someone without an eating disorder would. I have cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Most days, my legs cramp so bad that I can barely walk. I am constantly cold, such to a point that my skin turns blue. Many times, I’m afraid that every day will be my last. Still, even with all of this,I am not underweight. My BMI is classified as obese. Yet, here I am. I have been on both sides of the weight spectrum. I have seen a lot in my 8 years of having an eating disorder. But even at a significantly low weight, I have never been as sick as I am now. At age 11, when this all started, I loved the quote: “Mind of an anorexic, Body of a failure.” Now, I contemplate this. Do I really have a body of a failure? Dry skin, irregular lab work, potential organ failure. Is that the body of a failure? Hair loss, little to no digestion, blue and frigid skin.Am I a failure?The answer is no. Unfortunately, eating disorders do “come in all shapes and sizes.” Eating disorders do not care about your weight, race, gender, sexuality, age, or anything else. Eating disorders prey on any and every victim they can get their hands on. Just because I have a higher BMI, does not mean I am not sick. I am ill. I could potentially die. All of this was to lose “a little bit of weight.” Mind of an anorexic? Yes. My mind is sick. I am mentally ill. Body of a failure? No. Size does not equal failure or success. In the end, regardless of shape or size, the result of an eating disorder is the same for all of us. Life or death.  

Wanting and willing are two very different experiences.You can want good grades, but that means nothing without being willing to study.Similarly, you can want to recover from your eating disorder, but without being willing to change behaviours, gain weight, challenge rules etc etc, you are not going to get very far.On the other hand, you don’t have to want recovery (at least initially) in order to be willing to change. You can be willing to give gaining weight a go without wanting it. I can assure you that the majority of recovered people out there would agree that they didn’t necessarily want to make the painful changes that recovery demanded. But they were willing to try.Be willing to try something new. Be willing to have an extra bite of dinner, to sit down instead of run, to nourish rather than punish. It is far too easy to become trapped in a state of wanting and wishing change without taking any actions. It is not enough. Don’t let your illness trick you into thinking it is. 

One of the hardest lessons I had to learn, and am still learning, is that I can’t save anybody. Not really. I can’t take their pain and make it better. I can just be there.The waiting game  



                                                Today a self harmer will put down their weapons for the last time. Today an anorexic will start eating again. Today a bulimic will will purge for the last time. Today people will realise that their past has no control over them. Today people will begin recovery, so why don't you become one of those people - today                    



Emergency Recovery BoxAfter my session with E on Wednesday she suggested making an ‘emergency recovery box’. I actually think it’s a brilliant idea and wanted to share it with you all. The concept is simple: fill a box full of your ‘go to’ distractions/grounding techniques so that you know where to go if you need help before/after a challenging meal or period of high anxiety. If you get stuck or feel you need some support, you can go to your box and either pick something out or take a random pick, give it a go and if it doesn’t help then you can put it back and try something else :) I think it’s a fabulous idea as I often get very ‘caught in the moment’ and forget some of the things that I could do to help myself. So far I have put in:An array of colouring books (I always forget I have these)A Listography bookDVD drive (to remind me I can watch Netflix/films)Some wool and a crochet hookFluffy socks (self care and cosy - uses ‘touch’)Some small nice smelling yankee candles3DS gamesA worry-manSome photographsHeadphonesTwo New Scientist magazines I have been meaning to readA pen (journal/write a letter) I was thinking of making a few post-it notes to write a few things on that I might not be able to physically put in the box, including; read a book, go for a short walk, find a cat, do a jigsaw puzzle, paint nails, message a friend, yoga/meditation, musical instruments (I haven’t picked these up in what feels like forever), reach out for support and photography. I may also write some positive statements on a flash card to pick out and read easily if I need a little ‘pick me up’. So, if you have a bit of spare time (actually this hardly takes any time at all, even better!) I challenge you to go and find a box/basket/bag/container and fill it with a few distractions of your own. It can be as big or as small as you please, there is no “right or wrong” here. Good luck!  

honestly sometimes i’m just amazed because three years ago my goal was “stay alive and don’t hurt yourself” now i have so many goals that i can’t keep track of them all; i wanna make people smile and think of dissertation topics and run 10 miles and do a ted talk and pet as many dogs as possiblei don’t have to settle for survival anymore and it’s the best feeling in the world

                j.m.n            


I feel like I frequently have to remind people that the eating disorder doesn’t only say things like “You’re fat,” “run for x amount of time,” or “don’t eat.” It frequently says things like, “Your friends all hate you and are just too polite to tell you they don’t want to see you,” “your boyfriend doesn’t love you, he just feels sorry for you,” “you’re so fucking stupid, you fuck up everything,” “you’re such a disgusting slut” etc etc etc.It’s hard to tell people that because they look at me with expressions of horror and question whether the eating disorder voice is actually some hallucination and I need a much different type of therapy.Like they’re my thoughts, but they’re simultaneously coming from a compartment of my brain that doesn’t feel like me at all. And it’s not just fleeting thoughts, it’s sometimes a constant litany of torture.Expecting someone in recovery to just ignore ED thoughts and not act on them is a bit ridiculous. It’s not a switch you can automatically turn off. You have to be constantly redirecting those thoughts as fast as they appear, and that’s an enormous feat. Those of us fighting eating disorders are so BRAVE and BADASS for dealing with abuse like that on an hourly basis all day every day and still getting up in the morning and doing exactly what makes those voices the loudest.People need to respect and honor that, and not just tell someone struggling to “just eat,” because that is so not what any of this is about. 

saying things like this…“my mum yelled at me yesterday! she’s so bipolar”“you almost gave me a panic attack”“you look so anorexic”“my OCD is coming out again”“i stayed up till 1am. my insomnia is so bad”“i swear i’m like retarded”“oh yeah, yesterday i was so depressed!“quit being psych”is not okay and can actually be quite insulting to people that suffer daily with these disorders.  

Took a selfie today and was kinda feeling, so I thought why not post it for @postitforward Mental Health Month! Make sure you join in their movement as the tasks change every week- ending stigma is a big feat but together- we can do it! Now go and do some good shiz 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 

 

friendly reminder:💫 you are a wonderful person💫 your mental illness is a piece of crap💫 you deserve recovery💫 you deserve happiness💫 you can do this, stay strong!💫 there is always someone who cares about you💫 you are not alone 

He said, “good thing you’re skinny” Yesterday at work, I was going about my usual morning. It was around 10am which means I was due for (one of) my morning snacks bc your girl snacks all day! I was sitting at the front desk eating a PowerCrunch bar getting some work done. One of the physicians in this office walked past and said, “wow, you’re eating again? It is a good thing you’re so skinny!”. Excuse me!? If I was any bigger, would it then be shameful for me to be eating? I feel like no one else would take such notice to this comment but it really bugs me. There isn’t anything wrong with eating or eating when hungry. I am doing everything I have been taught to do; to honor my hunger cues. I don’t even think twice when grabbing a snack. It is just so bizarre to me that someone felt the need to say something. Another co-worker who I love dearly saw me eating a banana an hour later and jokingly asked me what number snack I was on for the morning. It is true, I eat all day. I don’t eat all day because I can get away with it. I don’t eat all day because I am “skinny”. I eat because I am hungry. I am usually really great at blocking out commentary from others about my intake but I just figured I’d share this since it really stuck with me. I hope you are all well! 

me 24/7 because your girl CRAVES validation

telling someone withanxiety to “just stop worrying”depression to “just cheer up”insomnia to “just go to sleep”anorexia to “just eat”bulimia to “just keep it in”self harm to “just stop cutting”problems to “just get over it”it’s like stabbing yourself in the stomach with a massive knife and saying “just stop bleeding” and then immediately feeling better…that’s not how it works…ok?…  

We tell everyone we’re better now;
Parties with friends,
Vodka and cokes
[diet please]
Late nights and lie ins
[missed breakfast]
New places and meals out
[I can’t eat there]
We tell ourselves we’re better now;
No more hospitals,
Living our lives
[clinically underweight]
Moments making memories
[I ate more that day]
No longer obsessive
[197 calories]
We keep saying we’re better now;
Listing tiny steps,
Seemingly important victories
[leaving the illness between the lines] 

One of my biggest fears of recovery, maybe the biggest, was gaining weight.And I know a lot of you are very afraid to gain weight.But gaining weight doesn’t mean becoming ugly, less worthy of disguisting. For me, it meant finding my worth, learning to love myself and live my life to the fullest. I didn’t blew up like a baloon, I didn’t become morbidly obese. I stopped obsessing over food, got rid of my food fears and anxieties. I started going out with my friends again and I’ve never been more confident and happier person. I know higher numbers may seem scary, but trust me when I say they’re not. There is nothing bad about being heavier than a certain number. It won’t end your life, it won’t make you unloved. It will help you to see how beautiful you can be, if you let yourself.On the first picture there’s me in 2017, on the other one me in 2019. There is a 20 kg difference. 

 

To everyone who is planning their relapse today - I hear you. Your pain is real, our world is frightening, and I am so, so sorry.But please remember that you are needed here. More than ever, this world needs you to fight. You can be the good among all of this hate. Stand tall, take a deep breath, and pick up your sword. Your presence makes a difference, even if you cannot find a way to speak. Let this be your victory, not his.  

Just bc others are relapsing + losing weight, doesn’t mean I need to as wellJust bc others are relapsing + losing weight, doesn’t mean I need to as wellJust bc others are relapsing + losing weight, doesn’t mean I need to as wellJust bc others are relapsing + losing weight, doesn’t mean I need to as wellJust bc others are relapsing + losing weight, doesn’t mean I need to as well 

If you had a bad day, a bad week, or heck even a bad year…Reblog this, drop an anon, or comment- I will text every single one of you 

 

in a mcr kinda mood lately 

why comment on what another person is eating when you could just be quiet 

Ice cream with a view🌅🍦

To everyone with an eating disorder who is nervous about thanksgiving:The ED voice is lyingYour struggle is still valid, no matter how much you eatYou don’t have to justify your ED to your familyIt is only one meal. Enjoy the good food and the good memories. “You are what you eat” is complete BS and your body will use the energy from your meal just the same. 

Hey just some lil things for you to remember!You haven’t eaten too much (even if you binged)Any food is good food!You need carbs, fats, fibre and sugars! Have a look up the daily recommended intake of those if you want more info, but don’t obsess over it! It is just a recommended intake amount.Your body looks gorgeous today! Everything about it is stunning ♥Don’t purge please, it’ll make you feel worse and it doesn’t even get rid of calories, don’t hurt yourself over food.Please be wary of pro-ana/mia blogs! They will just make your mindset worse, surround yourself with happy and positive things and people.Keep exercise to a reasonable amount for your intake.You are loved and you are beautiful, I promise!If you need someone to talk to I’m always here ^u^ 

It’s okay to feel whatever you are feeling. Your feelings are valid. You are not “overreacting” and you are not “being too sensitive” and you don’t need to “just get over it.” Don’t listen to people who tell you otherwise. 

thirteen years ago, when i was first diagnosed with several mental health conditions and put on scary medications, i could not have told you that one day i would feel in control of my autonomy again. twelve years ago when i was spending most of the months in a year hospitalised, i wouldn’t have believed that i was capable of feeling that happy bubble inside me anymore, nevermind having the capacity to feel it several times a week! ten years ago, when i was kicked out of home and forced to live in temporary accommodation for several years, i never would have believed that i could one day learn the skills to manage independently as an adult and actually feel in charge of my own life and my own future. seven years ago, when i had several attempts at my life, i could not have told you that these days most of my days are good mood days. five years ago, when i reached rock bottom with my eating disorder, i didn’t ever want to reach a healthy weight again. now i can manage to maintain my weight at a safe level for my height as an outpatient in the community. two years ago, when i was suicidal again and self harming every day, i believed i would always be a burden on this world, but i went back to school and now i have meaningful employment and i feel proud of what i can give back to society. one year ago i thought i would always be defined by my illnesses, but today i can sit in my apartment, which i live in with my best friend and all our plants, and i can believe that i am worthy of an identity and that i am strong enough to manage my disorders. i am bigger and greater than what tried to hold me back  

They say they understand
As if they are the ones
Cleaning vomit from their clothes
On Christmas Eve,
Their family’s laughter rising
From the room below.
They say they understand
Like they know the pain
Of stepping in a shower
And allowing the water
To harshly sting
Their open wounds.
They say they understand
As though they too
Have memorized
Every calorie
On every menu
They’ve ever seen.
They say they understand
In such a way that
You know they believe
That watching the flames
Hurts as much
As standing in them. 

Today is going likeI want food, but I’m not hungry, but I am, but I’m bloated and don’t want to eat, but I just really want to eat something, but I don’t want to gain weight, but I want to recover, but I have to eat to recover, but give me that nuggets will ya, but KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME ARE YOU INSANE, but COME BACK HERE AND GIMME THAT PIZZA U FUCKER 

some things i have learnt about eating disorder recovery:
- if a food makes you happy or you crave it a lot, have some! depriving yourself of food is just gonna make you crave it more and when you finally snap you will binge eat 10x more bad things than if you just had this one small thing
- recovery takes time !!! lots of time !! ive had my ed for 5 years and ive fallen in and out of recovery and its hard but it is doable!!! 
- ive lost more weight nourishing my body with healthy things and exercising a few times a week than i ever did starving myself
- self love is not a sudden thing. no one wakes up entirely in love with themselves. it takes time and energy and yes ! its okay not to like certain things about yourself but they make you unique and most of the time they cant be changed and thats okay!!!
- thigh gaps r not for everyone!!! not everyone can achieve a thigh gap! it completely depends on your bone structure, you could be at the lowest weight possible and still not have a thigh gap because of your bone structure but thats okay! thigh gaps do not determine your worth as a human (but if you do have a thigh gap thats fine too! everyones bodies are different)
- eat more fruit and veggies!!! honestly!!! blend them in a smoothie or cook them or eat them with chocolate, who cares!!! they will help ur skin, ur hair and ur mood as well as many other benefits. try and eat at least 2 or 3 portions a day because yes theyre expensive and not everyone can manage 5 a day. 
- u are allowed to treat urself with unhealthy food!!! ur body is smart and can cope with u eating a slice of cake or a bar of chocolate
- u should not fear food!!! food is ur friend!!! especially healthy foods, but also unhealthy foods for when u need them.
- throwing up your food does more damage than it ever will do good. it is so bad for ur emotional and physical well being and is found to make u gain more weight than lose it ! 
- u shouldnt feel the need to lose weight. if u want to do it in a healthy way thats ur choice but people see more in you than just a number or a body i promise
- your ed will not vanish overnight. it takes months, maybe years of recovery to feel fully recovered but you can get better everyday and it will be so worth it when you look back and think about how far u have come !!! ❤️ 

For making me see being in the hospital for anorexia as an admirable life goal, and for making me spend my 20s trying my hardest to be in an eating disorder ward until I die. 



FUCK EATING DISORDERS!!!!!!!
Less than a week into recovery and I have so much more energy!!! I haven’t painted in months and I had the energy to paint two animals in just a day. Yes, recovery is HARD and I look like I’m 20 months pregnant from all the bloating but honestly? It’s worth it. I’m so much happier. Fuck my ed. I hope he chokes on all the bread I’ve been munching on ✌️ 

in Summer 2017 i was diagnosed with anorexia. i weighed 108 lbs for 5′7″, which was lower than my intial ugw, and i attempted suicide because i still felt too fat. i begged my family for professional help and started seeing a psychiatrist. doctors thought inpatient treatment wouldn’t be beneficial because i seemed motivated, i had just graduated high school with extremely good grades, and i was accepted in a really good school, so being hospitalized would have ruined it.i gained a bit, but not much - refeeding was hard. i stayed underweight for a good while - i was on the waiting list to see a nutritionist. when i started seeing her, she encouraged me to eat as much as i wanted. i started eating 6 small meals a day. i gained weight more rapidly. in September, i was considered physically recovered. my blood results were adequate, and i weighed 123 lbs.but i kept gaining weight, and it worried me a lot. in January 2018, i started seeing a dietician closer to where i lived. turned out i wasn’t eating properly at all. my weight was good, but i was eating too much, and not the right things. it freaked me out a lot, but the dietician gave me a personalized, balanced meal plan, and it helped me a lot. i stopped seeing the other nutritionist. i weighed 132 lbs.in Summer 2018, i was able to donate my blood. it felt good. my blood results were perfect, and i was healthy. i thought i worried less about my body, too. but then i was wrong. i don’t know what happened - i feel like i just looked in the mirror and saw all the weight i had put on appear on my body at once. my psychiatrist put me on anti depressants. they worked good i guess, but they also gave me horrible side effects - including night binging. i gained weight again. i tried restricting again in August. my boyfriend grew increasingly worried. eventually he convinced me to stop.in November, i was diagnosed with adenomyosis and endometriosis. i was devastated. wanting to have children someday was my main reason for recovering, and in the end my uterus was still fucked up, despite all my efforts. i relapsed and stopped my antidepressants brutally in an attempt to control my weight. my blood results were awful. i weighed 138 lbs.i kept having small periods of time where i’d try restricting, but living with parents who were very much aware of my diagnosis made it close to impossible, so the relapses were manageable. my immune system was shit, and i was severely anemic. a bad case of influenza in February made me lose 6 lbs. my dietician assured me that it was a perfect weight for my height, and that instead of focusing on losing weight, i should instead try and restore the muscle mass my anorexia had annihilated. i wasn’t convinced. i weighed around 132 lbs.in April 2019 i relapsed again. my therapist didn’t help, and i couldn’t bare to explain what was going on to my dietician or my parents. i knew they would just try to stop me, and they couldn’t help with what was going on in my head, so it was better to hide it all. i only talked about it with my fiancé, because i trusted him enough. i am still relapsing now. i have lost 6 lbs so far, and i keep lowering my calorie intake - since i still live with my parents, i still restrict at around 1000 calories, which is significantly higher than most anorexics, but - plot twist - is still very dangerous for your health.i am supposed to move in with my fiancé in 3 days, after 4 years of long distance relationship. yesterday evening he texted me this -“i want to live with you so bad, but i’m not so sure it’s a good idea anymore. i don’t know if i’ll be able to care for you. i am terrified that you’ll just kill yourself faster i we have our own place”you don’t know how much this hurts. this hurts more than a binge, or gaining weight. the person i love the most is scared to live with me because of my eating disorder. because of what i do to myself.recovery is really fucking hard, especially when you don’t get proper care. but please, please, please. there is no “i am pro recovery just not in it”. it’s a lie. you know you are sick. please get help. there is no other way out of this. your ugw is a lie. you won’t feel any better. i had reached my ugw. my pictures were being shared as thinspo - the most famous one was me in a pink bra, hands on my hips. i had the tumblr staff delete it for me because it was too painful seeing it passing around on my dash all day. i still attempted suicide because i. did. not. see. a. fucking. difference. you will never feel skinny, or pretty, or worthy of wearing cute clothes and bikinis. never. recovery is the only way and you know it.i know my story doesn’t seem good. it’s not a very good recovery story. hell, i’m posting food logs everyday. i know i’m not doing good. but if i had asked for proper help, if i had been honest with the professionals who were supposed to help me, i wouldn’t be like this now. it would still be hard, but not like that.i am losing the person i love the most because of this disorder. i still feel unable to stop. i don’t know what i’m gonna do and i feel like i am in too deep. but i am still gonna do my best because nobody deserves to be beat by this illness. not even me.you know what’s good for you. please try. 

Nothing makes me sadder than watching 12, 13, 14 year olds experiencing horrific mental illnesses and being hospitalized - you tiny babies don’t deserve this and it breaks my heart.  

Thank you Ana for the way I hate my friends who are thinner than me and am jealous of people who are near death because of you 

today is world eating disorders action day. thank you @nedafeedinghope for providing these 9 truths about eating disorders. please reblog to spread awareness- and remember, you are not alone 🌟💖

DEPRESSION IS NOT SPECIAL.ANXIETY IS NOT CUTE.SELF HARM SCARS ARE NOT BEAUTIFUL.SUICIDE IS NOT POETIC.EATING DISORDERS ARE NOT GLAMOROUS,SCHIZOPHRENIA IS TERRIFYING.DON’T PRETEND TO HAVE HALLUCINATIONS.YOU DON’T FUCKING WANT THEM.MENTAL ILLNESSES ARE NOT ROMANTIC SO STOP TREATING THEM THAT WAY! 

Today is my birthday and I’ll eat a slice of cake. I won’t purge after. I will eat that damn thing and it won’t make me immediately obese. It won’t. It won’t. I promise myself it won’t. Today anorexia won’t win.  

Fuck anorexia and the idea that I would only be good enough when I was thin 

- Your ED is lying to you- Losing more weight will not make you love yourself more- Losing weight will not make the people around you love you any more than what they already do- Eating normally again will truly make you feel better physically and mentally- Weight loss does not cure a negative body image.  And long as you continue to have a negative view of yourself, you will never like how you look, no matter how much weight you lose. 

I love sunflowers a whole bunch🌻

For being terrified to have a shower, because I can’t stand my reflection in the mirror, or even looking at my body. 

 

Made a little floral doodle….anyone have any requests? x

i’m wearing an outfit today that i don’t feel comfortable in at all- everybody can see that i’m losing/have lost most of my thigh gap. and at first glance? i feel like crying. i grab the fat on my thighs as tears slip down. but you know what? i didn’t take off that outfit. because A THIGH GAP IS NOT RELEVANT TO MY GOALS AND DREAMS. IT DOESNT HELP ME ACHIEVE ANYTHING. I AM MORE THAN THE THIGH GAP I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE!!!!! i’m losing my thigh gap, but i’m gaining freedom!!!! trust from my parents!!!! self love!!!!!! i’m reaching my goals!!!!! so honestly? goodbye thigh gap. you caused me so much suffering. it’s time for you to go.  

please forgive yourself because you are a human being and you deserve that 

your feelings are valid you always survive it’s okay to cryit always gets betteryou are worthy of lovebreath and be gratefulno feeling is final

me:5 seconds later: 

Me now vs me at my lowest weight 
I gained so much it’s unbelievable 
I do hate my body still but at least now I can eat, I can walk for more than 30 minutes at a time, and my hair stopped falling out 
I don’t know if I said this before but at my worst state, I couldn’t eat solid foods at all, I had to drink a protein shake, and I couldn’t even drink the whole thing in a day 
I miss my “sick” body but that’s about it 
It hurts but recovery is worth it  

 

February to August 😂 

This is something my therapist mentioned this week and I’ve been thinking about it since…- When you say something like ““I want to die” or “I can’t eat that”, ask yourself whether that’s really you speaking - is it something you would have said before you became ill? Does it fit with what you really want in life?- Make a list comparing the real you to the eating disorder/anxiety/depression - I made two columns, Nicole and The Illness. In the first column are the things I want in life, things I know are true but don’t always believe; “I am loved” ““I want to recover” whereas in the second are irrational thoughts like “I don’t deserve help”and “I deserve to die”. Try and be as honest as possible with this. - Look at the ‘You’ column and really focus on it. Write them out on big sheets of paper, stick them round your room, make a mood board of them, repeat them over and over, just try and believe them. - If you can, show your therapist, friends, family, anyone involved in your recovery these lists. It can be helpful for them to know the things you might say when in an irrational mind and how they could argue with them using your rational thoughts.Keep fighting, keep believing in you 💕 

I know anorexia recovery isn’t about the weight. But sometimes it feels like it is. Some days in recovery, all you can see, all you can feel, is your body and how it’s changed. It feels impossible to live with. It feels like accepting your “new” body will never happen. And it does. Slowly, over time. A little over two years ago, I wrote a post about struggling to accept my body. I was four months post-treatment the second time. I had weight-restored to a higher weight than I had the first time around, and I was sure that I wouldn’t make it. And I did. I took the energy I had previously put into losing weight and applied it to recovery instead. I went to therapy, I ate my meals and snacks, I didn’t relapse into restriction, over-excercise, or purging. I did the hard things. Here I am today, just two years later, living life completely symptom-free, accepting my body as it is, even loving it at times. I used to give my power away, to allow the number on the scale to define my worth and value. I have taken that power back. I define myself by what I love. I find myself to be inherently worthy, simply because I’m human. I didn’t know this kind of life was out there waiting for me. And it was. And it’s waiting for you too. 

Pause. Close your eyes. Take a breath. Hear your beating heart. You are alive and deserve to be here. Never doubt your worth. Today is a perfect day to love yourself. @madsrecovers  

Turning to your eating disorder when you’re going through a hard time won’t make things easier for you. It’s not going to solve your problems and you’re not going to be happier just because you’re feeding into the disordered thoughts.  

does anyone else not want to eat when they get upset? every time someone upsets me or makes me mad my immediate response is to refuse food/not eat.

Kind of personal, and I have mentioned a little about this part of my life in the past- I have been in recovery from an eating disorder for almost 3 years now (will be 3 years in late August). but the past few months have been a pretty serious relapse that has little by little gotten out of control. I can’t do it alone anymore. Per my therapist’s suggestion, I’m going back to a treatment center soon, before this gets worse. Not residential or for 6 months or anything like last time, likely intensive outpatient, but this just,, this really really sucks. I’m so terrified. I don’t want to give someone else control over what I eat and what my body will look like. I want to be able to do so much in life, and I’m impatient with myself, and expecting too much of myself; I piled too much work on myself and I crashed.Anyway, on Monday I’ll know if this one center will take me, and I’m extremely anxious about it. Any support or good vibes sent this way are much appreciated.

Most people with eating disorders aren’t anorexic.
Most people with eating disorders aren’t underweight.
Most people with eating disorders aren’t vain.
Some bulimics don’t make themselves sick.
Some people with eating disorders don’t abuse laxatives or diet pills.
Some people with eating disorders don’t count calories.

Some people with eating disorders dont fit in the neatly defined categories, some are told they are not ill enough, refused treatment.
Your illness is no less valid because you don’t fit a stereotype. Many professionals do not understand this horrific illness and that is not your fault.01494 793223

This is a great UK helpline that’s probably saved my life - there’s a small charity and there’s not always someone available but they WILL call you back, no matter whether you’re anorexic, bulimic, diagnosed or none of the above. It’s just someone who understands and will listen. Keep fighting sweetie x 

i am more. i am more than the the calories i consume. i am more than the inches around my waist. i am more than the chub on my tummy. i am more than the size of my pants. i am more than my eating disorder. i am so much more.

Hey. Just stopping by to remind you that you are loved, cared about, and appreciated. Carry on.

please read it.i need to start posting again….. im sorry. i disappeared for some time from tumblr. i needed to. i met incredible people in here and its saddening to see what they are doing with themselves. im back. fully recovered. my soul and mind are back. and i feel like i needed to make some things straight. since i developed an eating disorder i felt that everything is so glamorized… every time i would try to recover bad things would always come back to my mind. starting with thinspo pictures and ending with quotes and poems. having an eating disorder is not just skipping meals. is lying. is disconnecting from others. is isolating yourself. betraying yourself. and so much more than that. having an eating disorder is a living hell. you wake up everyday and the only thing that crosses your mind is: food. and for so long i thought it was normal. but now i realized that the normal things to cross your mind when you wake up are: the sun touching my window as i open my eyes. all the new possibilities i can do today. and so much more.after some time i started to notice that people only talk about the sick part. everyone just explains how it is to live with this. i dont feel that people really talk about recovery. they make movies about e.d’s and not about e.d recovery. this is the most saddening thing. because people. like me. like you. we are afraid of what’s next. we are afraid and we want explanations. we want to see if its scaring and worth it. and since i have this blog. i will show you that it is. even me. who would wrote “dont eat” in every single sketchbook. in every single piece of paper i could find just to remind myself that what other people think about me matter and even if it doesn’t i want to be skinny. i dont wanna be worthless. i haven’t seen a movie in recovery. i saw lily collins going through hell. but at the end they just showed us her. walking inside the treatment house. choosing recovery. but what happens? she will collapse? she will finally find herself again? she will inspire others to do the same? we. dont. know.the truth is out there. we should glamorize recovery. and not the sickening part of having an eating disorder. because there is so much bravery in recovery. you couldn’t even imagine. there is bravery in being soft.remain soft. remain you. 



I did not want to get up today. I did. 
I did not want to eat breakfast. I did.
I did not want to take my dog out. I did.
I did not want to get the bus. I did.
I did not want to meet my friend. I did.
I did not want to buy myself anything. I did.
I did not want to eat. I did.
I did not want to go for a meal. I did.
I did not want to finish it. I did.
I do not want to eat again today. I will.
I do not want to tidy my room. I will.
I do not want to take my meds. I will.
I do not want to watch tv. I will.
I do not want to make art. I will.
Every day hundreds of things I do not want to do, things I fear, don’t have the motivation to do, haven’t done for a long time. But I am doing them and I will keep doing them.
For me.

Me, after being in highly intensive treatment for over two weeks 

Monday: It’s okay to take time for yourself, it’s okay to love and appreciate yourself.Tuesday: Eat that slice of cake, you only live once. Indulge yourself.Wednesday: You have a special purpose in the world, and you have so much to live for.Thursday: There are so many things about you which are beautiful. You may not see it, but many others do.Friday: Your illness(s) do not define you. You are the smell of roses, you are the sound of waves crashing at the beach, you are an individual.Saturday: Again: You are an individual - you don’t have to be pretty like them, you can be pretty like you.Sunday: Do not be ashamed of yourself. Embrace and express yourself - your culture, your sexuality, your hair colour. Be you. 

Struggling in recovery from anorexia is not synonymous with restritcting and I think that it’s something a lot more people need to begin to recognise. 

Trigger Warning - Hunger/Fullness & RestrictingME EVERY DAY EVEN IN RECOVERY9am: Not hungry11am: Not hungry1pm: Still not hungry3pm: Thirsty?4:30pm: SO FUCKING HUNGRYAnyone else feel this? 

This is Lucy; we met just over a year ago in a childrens’ psychiatric ward, we were told that friendships made in hospital don’t last and are toxic. How could we be friends with the same competitive illnesses and struggles?Yesterday she came with me to an appointment, advocated on my behalf and said things I was too afraid to. We helped each other to make plans to improve our mental health, made sure we both ate enough whilst not feeling overwhelmed and spoke about everything and nothing for hours. If I’m upset, I know I can pick up the phone and talk to her, with healthy boundaries both ways and an understanding that we might not always be able to help each other and we’re not professionals. If I’m especially happy, I can send her silly photos or call screaming about how cute my dog is being or how funny a moment at work was. Its not all about our illnesses. We both know we are more than that; we are our hilariously different styles and hobbies, our shared love of animals and 00s chart music, our strange phrases and ways of talking that other people don’t understand. We’re not 2 girls who have the same illness, we are 2 friends who care about eachother deeply. She won’t see this because she doesn’t use tumblr but I wanted to say, friendships found from the worst times can be incredible.Love you Luce 

@madsrecovers 

With my newfound knowledge that a chronic illness community exists on here I will say this one thing! I hate when people tell me all my shit would go away if I cut out certain foods or fasted or whatever! I am anorexic and it’s extremely triggering!! But even if I wasn’t anorexic, this whole “wholesome dieting” is just as much a part of diet culture as anything else, stop making it seem like my illness is my own fault or really in my control at all!!!! When I cut out food or do a fast I relapse!!!!!! my current health is not from a lack of taking care of myself!!!!! And you can’t really think I haven’t tried all of that before!!!!!!! Mind your business!!!!!!!!!!!  

if you’re trans and you have a restrictive ed please remember that your body does not have to be small to pass. you’re perfect the way you are and you losing weight will not cure your dysphoria. you’re just gonna end up dysphoric and ill. the control an eating disorder pretends to give you is fake and please don’t let it take until you’re in the hospital because you blacked out going up some stairs to realize that. 

And what a strange feeling it is, to miss something that very nearly killed you. - Nostalgia feels like the wrong word.  

 

🌸🧬💘💓Life really is too short to be worrying about how my body looks and what I eat. It’s time to just be happy and free and enjoy this life🌸🧬💘💓 

Three months later and I am finally free!

                I need you to know I am slowly coming to terms with all of this 


Didn’t want to get out of bed or eat today, but my boyfriend got up and came back into the room with a plate of pizza, saying “I know you don’t feel like moving so I brought you food” and then he put on the muppets treasure island movie and got in bed next to me. So I got to stay in bed all day, eating pizza and laughing at this silly movie with the person I love more than anything in the world. I’ve just ???? I’ve never been this happy??? I’m so very grateful that I found someone like him.  

This is my life Recovery, relapse, relapse, relapse, recovery, relapse, recovery, relapse, relapse.. 

Having my cake and eating it too🍰

                j.m.n            


I sit across the table from my mom, an amazing dinner in front of us and the sound of the TV playing softly in the next room. It seems so quiet.But I can see it. I see the way her eyes glance over every inch of the food, calculating the risk of each ingredient. I see the way the lines next to her eyes vanish as the thoughts become louder and the laughter falls silent. I see the way she looks at me when she thinks I’m not paying attention, tearing away pieces of bread and hiding them under her napkin. I see when she gets up with only half of her meal gone and walks quickly back to the kitchen. I hear the running of the faucet as the other half of what I made for her disappears into the sink. And I want to tell her. I want to tell her that every bite is not a war, that she does not have to write her pain on her body for me to see it. I want to tell her that she has permission to eat, that food is fuel, that she does not have to deprive herself in order to be worthy. I want to tell her that I understand, that I still struggle sometimes. I want to tell her that I remember. I remember going to restaurants and wiping the oil off of my fries, pushing the food around to make it look like I tried. I want to tell her that I remember when nurses sat next to me, watching my every move; tears falling sharply down my face as I begged them to take the sandwich away from me. I want to tell her that I remember when my only sense of safety came from the gnawing pit in my stomach and the numbers running in my mind, going lower and lower.I want to tell her that I love her and that she deserves to get better.But then I remember that I can’t. Because she doesn’t see it. She doesn’t see what I see; she doesn’t know that there is a life outside of an eating disorder that is more beautiful than she could possibly imagine.And so I sit at the table alone, and I eat every bite, and I allow myself to remember. Because even though she made the easy choice, I don’t have to.I choose to live.

Your body’s response when you treat it right (LOVE THIS!) 

Ice (S)CREAMing because this pint was a 10/10, I was tempted to finish the whole pint because omg it was so tasty- non dairy? No biggie!!!! 

Recovery is about being brave enough to move out of the house and meet new people instead of staying at home with your self-hatred and doing sit-ups in secret.Recovery is about being brave enough to be yourself, open up for strangers because those strangers will become friends later.Recovery is about visiting Christmas markets because the food isn’t the main focus anymore, eating what you like, how much you like and when you would like to.Recovery is about being spontaneous, crazy and lively. It’s about finding secret cafés, sitting down to talk for hours, forgetting about the hustle-bustle outside the place. It’s forgetting about calories, fear foods and insecurities. It’s about being in the present.Recovery is about laughing until your stomach hurts and being happy because your stomach hurts for a very different reason than it used to.Recovery is talking about your memories with a smile on your face and a full tummy.Recovery is not easy. It’s fucking hard most of the times. It’s exhausting and uncomfortable.Yet, when you can see that recovery is so much more than just food, numbers and scales, that’s when you know it was all worth it.Recovery is about living again. Finding the real you and being the person who you want to be (not who others want you to be) and being that person without shame and regret. 

snack time is all the time  

some things (that you might not realise) that can be hurtful to people recovering from an eating disorder:“I’ve only eaten x and x today” “oh she’s sooo skinny! body goals!”talking about how much exercise you’ve done/ how much you ‘need’ to exercise/ TELLING THEM TO EXERCISE (most people in recovery are on an exercise hiatus until they are mentally/physically stable enough to return to it. it is GOOD for their bodies to not be exercising.)talking/ acting negatively towards your own/ someone else’s body (you shouldn’t be doing this anyway, its not going to be anything but toxic for anyone…)diet/ diet culture talk. this should be fairly obvious but talking about ‘how too much x or x is bad for you’ or ‘x food group makes you gain weight!’ is a) ridiculous and b) not what someone trying to learn how to look after themselves again needs to hear.sharing details about your own unhealthy habits with another person suffering. this CAN be helpful if both people are okay discussing the subject matter. but please make sure your friend/ family member is okay to talk about these things with you.asking questions/ talking about the sufferer’s food/meals/habitsdrawing attention to the fact that they are eating (eating in front of people is very commonly SO HARD for a lot of people. please be gentle.)touching them. people in recovery most likely really uncomfortable in their bodies. this does get easier but make sure it’s okay before you give them a playful poke or squeeze or anything.It can be ridiculously hard for someone to speak up about what can be harmful to them. Eating disorders are not to be fucked with, the sufferer is literally fighting an impulse to slowly die, and they have to face that reality 3-6 times a day. They are probably in an extremely vulnerable state, whether it shows or not. If your friend or family member is in that situation, avoiding some of these things, even if it might seem like nothing to you, could save them some unnecessary extra pain and stress.If this post seems a little harsh, it’s because eating disorders are harsh. I’m beyond angry about the amount of romanticising bullshit that gets spread about surrounding hurting yourself. DO NOT TAKE EATING DISORDERS LIGHTLY. 

my period has made me eat more no surprise!!…I’m gonna start skipping lunch and replacing it w/ fruit and caffeine to lose the weight I’ve gained when it’s over.In other news I ran a 5K today woo!! No clue how much it burned but i’m proud I did it anyway :) Gonna do another one next weekStay safe <3 

my mind is constantly switching between wanting to recover, eat anything i want and wanting to starve myself ‘till i’m lighter than a feather. and that’s exhausting. 

Blueberry whole grain waffles topped with butter & syrup, strawberries, and coffee for breakfast. Being home with a kitchen is nice🍓☕️ 

🌸 

Would y'all be interested in a ana(or any other eating disorder) recovery discord server/chatroom? 

Do you guys ever wonder how life would be without an eating disorder? No more binging. No more starving.No more purging. No more canceling plans.No more losing friendships. No more wearing loose clothing. No more being stuck in your room. No more endless thoughts about food. No more fighting. Just pure happiness…

One Last Thing If I do not make it out of this two hour assessment, I just want you ALL to know that I am thankful for each and every one of you and the support you have all given me. I am really terrified. I am not sure what went wrong all of a sudden, or if it was really very sudden at all. I think, in this very moment, sitting outside of this Big Scary treatment center, I have realized how sick I am. And that scares me. I have no idea what they might do. Dr. Cheetah Print said they might hospitalize and tube me, which is my biggest fear at this point. In less than 30 minutes, I am going to have to re-hash my symptoms, diagnoses, trauma history, and whatever else. This is going to be scary. But maybe not as scary as where I had to go before I met CB. So that is a good thing. Because CB reminds me all the time that I did that alone and that it was probably the bravest and biggest thing I have ever done. And then I made it to her and she helped me from there. As I type this, I am watching the people from the pictures on the website walk inside. They look the same as in the pictures. They are real people. What a strange concept. They look nice enough. I hope they actually are. My stomach hurts. This is going to be hard. Another hospital. Another therapist. And what if they DO tube me? Do I hold my own hand and comfort myself? Because no one else is here with me. I wish more than anything that I could have physical versions of all of you here right now. Nearly 2,000 people might be considered abundant support. :-). Terrified might be an understatement. But whatever happens, please know that I love you all and all of the messages (although unanswered at the moment), comments, likes, and reblogs never go unnoticed. I love you all. ♥️-Grace  

I lied and said I was busy; but not in a way most people understand. I was busy taking deeper breaths. I was busy silencing irrational thoughts. I was busy calming a racing heart. I was busy telling myself I am okay. Sometimes this is my busy and I will not apologize for it • Journalling away the evening sads. 

This is my body.
It’s taken a lot to post it and it took a lot to do the photo shoot anyway, but here I am. My body no longer has sharp bones sticking out, the way my girlfriend wrote about- how they could seen my spine through my dress in Paris. No, my body has curves. I am a short, curvy girl. I have narrow shoulders, little breasts, a curvy waist and large hips. But that makes me me. I am a size 3 in shoe, but I would not try to fit my foot into a size 7- so why would I force my body into a shape it’s not meant to be? 
I have scars. Quite a few. They are by no means beautiful, but they do not make me ugly. They should how hard life got but are proof that I live to tell the tale. I have small stretch marks on my legs. I was insecure about them as they show how I have grown. But why am I angry at myself for taking up space?
It’s taken a lot to write this as I’m falling back into old habits, and I know the signs that this is how it starts. But I will fight for my right to have shape. To bear my arms. To take up space.
I am uncontainable. 

 

this book is helping me so much … anyone in recovery from a restrictive eating disorder get on it. the author also has podcasts and youtube 

Every tiny victory is important. 

Your body NEEDS food as fuel. Without fuel, your memory will suck, you won’t be able to concentrate, and you will feel sick and cold. All. The. Time.
You have exams coming up, and you HAVE TO EAT if you want to stand any chance of passing. So, please stop trying to convince yourself of irrational things like that you “don’t need to have breakfast” or that “you’re not really hungry” or that “you’ll eat later”, because it’s your eating disorder talking, and your eating disorder is trying to kill you.
Your body deserves nourishment. And nourishment at the moment means EATING THE DAMNED FOOD. Don’t give up on everything just yet, keep going.

Eating disorder ≠ My PersonalityWhat we need to learn everyday.  

If you are in recovery PLEASE don’t compare your daily intake to other people on here who are also in recovery!  A lot of the “recovery meal plans” I’ve seen in the tags are still pretty small.  It can be triggering to see the tiny portions other people are eating.  Don’t worry if your meals are bigger, or if you eat more snacks throughout the day!  Everyone’s recovery plan is a little different, and it’s important that you are following a diet that is most suitable to YOUR needs 

Reminder 2You deserve to eat and take care of yourself!

Park Jimin: eat well and don’t get sick! Me: I’M trYInG  

With a restrictive eating disorder: crying and miserable because you felt like you ate too muchIn recovery: crying and miserable because you felt like you ate too much, but realizing that thought is disordered so you push through and keep eating anyways, knowing you’re working towards freedom even if you don’t feel it right this second 

Panda Express at work LIKE A BOSS 

I feel :) so :) depressed :) rn :)) 

I’ll look exactly like this And I’ll finally be happy and loved  

I hate that there’s this pro-ana/pro-mia/pro-ED community.I know they say eating disorders are good, beautiful, helpful…. but here’s the truth of having an eating disorder:You’ll be hungry. So hungry it hurts. But eventually your hunger cues will go away and you’ll feel sick to your stomach at the thought of food.It’s rooted in your brain, possibly there forever. Even if you don’t act on them, the thoughts will come back after you recover.As much as bottling it up hurts, it’s next to impossible to talk about. No one really understands unless they’ve been through it, and you dread the thought of people constantly watching you eat, or even worse, being hospitalized and force fed.By the time you realize what you’re doing could hurt the people you love, it’s too late. And you’ll continue to hate yourself for that.You think you’re repulsive, disgusting, worthless.You’re a perfectionist. Not just about your appearance, but about your grades, personality, hobbies. And it’s not just beating yourself up a bit over it. It’s loathing yourself and being angry for any little mistake you’ve made.No one takes you seriously unless you’re emaciated and weak, or dead.Your eating disorder will make you lash out, do unhealthy things. Sometimes hurting other people. And as much as you know that’s not the real you, when it comes down to it, the person responsible for those actions is YOU.You have almost no life outside your eating disorder. Because you’ve dropped your hobbies, lost interest in the things you used to love. And you forget your personality traits that used to make you who you are, because you’re so caught up in your eating habits, that you don’t have time to think about those things. You almost lose yourself.When it comes down to it, you secretly hope someone will save you, pay attention to you, and help you.

Because having and eating disorder isn’t all it’s made out to be. It’s awful. It’s painful. And it’s no way to live.

 

It is ok to eat candy!It is ok to enjoy candy!It is ok not to eat candy…but try to listen to the real you, not your disorder, and if you want candy, try to take that step to eat some and enjoy it! You deserve it and it is so so okay to eat and like things that taste good! That being said this can be a triggering time, especially for those who struggle with bingeing. Take good care of yourself and be gentle with you!!! Feel free to message me if you need to talk to someone.It can also be isolating to be struggling/experiencing fear/anxiety around something while everyone around you is celebrating and partying and excited. It is ok to struggle sometimes. You are not alone!Happy Halloween!!!  

I’m going to eat. No matter how hard it isNo matter how much anorexia is screaming at meNo matter how scared I am of gaining weight or feeling full or losing controlNo matter how guilty I feelEven when I feel like I don’t deserve it No matter how painful my emotions become (because not eating will not take them away; don’t listen to anorexia when it tells you not eating will fix your other mental illness)No matter how much anorexia makes me want to scream at and hit my mum to let me not eatBecause I don’t want to go to hospitalBecause staying at home will be better for my recoveryEven when I want to disappear (because the people around me won’t let me; they’ll keep me alive by force if they have to)Because the more I don’t eat, the harder it gets to get back on track Because, even though I hate feeling emotions so intensely and so quickly, I don’t want to be an emotionless zombie eitherBecause, even though anorexia may make life seem simpler, there’s more to life than not eating and losing weightBecause people won’t work with me on the emotional/cognitive sides of my illnesses if I’m doing life-threatening thingsBecause anorexia is an illness and not something desirable (even though it tricks you into wanting it)Because when I don’t eat I’m not in control, even though it seems like I amIt’s not me that’s controlling what I eat and how much I weigh and what I am and what I do and what I’m worth; it’s anorexia that’s controlling me 

A friend recently told me that she sees “a new confidence in me” and it’s true. Recovery has allowed me to love myself. 

o hi its me 

Wishing you all a lovely Memorial Day weekend if you celebrate. 
Remember that all of the food and treats you encounter today are NORMAL and OKAY! 
Eat that hotdog. Say yes to the chips. It’s okay. 
I had probably what is the most normal “pre-ed summertime meal” ever. 
A beyond burger with cheese and a bun, fruit salad, chips and French onion dip, Stewart’s cream soda, and a salad!! 
For dessert, we are having ice cream bars. 
The air is warm, the sun is bright, and I am one happy gal. Stay strong loves. You can do this 💛
 

DISCHARGE DATE 🥂 6 months ago vs today: firstly I haven’t recovered, I haven’t gained weight or become a new person BUT I have taken quite a few steps in that direction 🌿 I have challenged myself, I have changed, most importantly I have found my love of life again ❤️ I’m not expecting it to be easy but nobody ever said it would be 🤔 Maybe from here things will only get better 📈 maybe there will be slips along the way 📉 but I am proud to say I am no longer in the place I was at the start of the year 🌅 The light is back in my eyes and my heart and there is hope. 😇 Recovery is a huge difficult painful journey but I know that we all have the strength to do it 💪🏻 with the right mindset and support 👩‍❤️‍👩💑👨‍❤️‍👨 Remember on the bad days there have been good days and on the good days there will be even better days. I am so happy to have started this account 🎀 and got to know so many of you beautiful humans ⭐️ My inpatient experience had been a dirty uncomfortable bumpy road 🌪 with some excellent travelling companions 💋 I haven’t reached my destination but I’ve realised that the views along the way are as important ⛅️ Keep fighting and allowing yourselves to grow 🌿🌱 goodbye hospital, hello life ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜 

We’re only as sick as our secrets. This week is national eating disorder awareness week, so I wanted to speak up, break the stigma, and share my experience with this deadly and often misunderstood disease. For a little over a year now, I’ve been in intensive treatment on and off for anorexia nervosa. This has no doubt been the hardest thing I’ve ever done- it takes a lot out of you to drop everything in your life and go to war with your own mind every single day. Every choice I make, every time I go against my eating disorder, I’m fighting for recovery. There have been times when I can’t make myself get out of bed, I just know I’ll never get better and I’m a hopeless case and this illness is how my story ends. But then I also have those days where I find myself smiling and laughing with the people I love and actually enjoying food I used to like, without freaking out with every bite I take. Recovery isn’t linear. I’m learning to accept my body at its healthy size and focus on appreciating it for what it can do, not how it looks. I’m learning to take pride in being strong, mentally and physically. I’ve met some of the most incredible people in the world. I’ve found that people with mental illness tend to be the most sensitive, compassionate, entertaining people there are and I’m so blessed to have found this community where I’m understood and accepted and supported. This journey may have been the most painful, trying, honest thing I’ve ever done, but dare I say it’s also the most beautiful and insightful path of self discovery I’ve ever embarked on. After all I’ve been through, all the tears and all the laughter and all the lessons, I wouldn’t change a thing because I’m finally becoming who I was always meant to be. “Its all going to be okay. None of us know how our lives are going to turn out. And I think it’s better that way.” TS

So while intentionally triggering my ed on this hellsite, I noticed there are a lot of people who try to counteract ana by telling us we can lose weight if we eat a healthy diet and don’t go under 1200 calories.Stop doing that. It’s not helpful.A lot of anorexics are already healthy weight or underweight and don’t need to lose any more.I mean have you seen any of these proana/thinspo blogs, a lot of them are already so small and want to be smaller. This attempt at being helpful only encourages them to continue losing weight when they shouldn’t be.Not to mention diets are bad for us, really, really bad for us. That 1200cal diet is just a sneaky way to restrict until our ed takes us back into it’s grips. Lets be blunt, anorexia is a vicious bitch. Some of us have no concept of what we really look like and a lot of us know excatly how we look and still can’t stop thinking we need to lose. Anorexia is not about weight, it’s about control and self hatred. Telling us we can lose weight in a healthy way is unhelpful. Recovery almost always brings weight gain even when we aren’t underweight. 

 

here i was, looking at the old pictures I have on my desk where my cheekbones are sharp and my eyes are sullen; self loathing. and i caught myself missing it. and it made me miserable. sad. made me feel like a failure. but you know fucken what? i didn’t fail at anything!!! MY EATING DISORDER FAILED ME!!!!! i’m done hating and i’m done romanticizing. LOOK AT THESE CHEEKS. YEAH. these cheeks are HEALTHY. these cheeks make my eyes SHINE. these cheeks allow me to smile!!!! these cheeks give me color!!!!! these cheeks!!!!! are beautiful!!!!!! they’re full of life!!!!! my cheekbones may not be as sharp as before- heck i don’t even know if i have any, but you know what!!!!!! it doesn’t matter!!!!! your cheeks are beautiful!!!!!! and so are you!!!!!! you are so much more than what your mind tricks you into thinking you could’ve been. you are okay. you are more than okay. 

“Stop being so depressed”You know what, you’re right, it’s kind of getting a little boring

Pancakes on a Thursday? Why not! 🥞
Usually I have pancakes on a Sunday with my mom but they were calling to me this morning!
Pancakes used to be such a fear food and now they’re part of my weekly routine. Today, I made Kodiak Cakes with bananas, peanut butter, and honey 🍯 such a good combo! 
I’m counting down the days to the weekend; seeing my girlfriend and having a nice lil date night at an Italian restaurant that we both love; running the Tough Mudder on Saturday!; going with a friend for her first tatto, and then a concert on Monday! 
I’m taking two days off from the gym to make sure I’m well rested for Saturday’s race. I’m also upping my carbs intake to ensure I get enough energy for it as it’ll be an all day thing probably 🙈 
Wishing you all well! 🌼
 

Can anyone else just automatically know when someone clearly has an ED? Like not at all by their body type but by their posture and facial expressions. Like ED-Dar? Or is that just me being weird? 
What’s kind of awesome though is I’m not at all competitive or triggered by this anymore. I’m more just heartbroken to see someone suffering. I just want to give hugs and tell them they’re perfect.
Small steps. 

I really hate transformation posts. I have always hated transformation posts. For me, it just adds another layer of competitiveness to recovery and somewhat disregards the struggles that I endured. I was clinically anorexic. Not your shock value anorexic. My image is not one that would appear when you type in “anorexia”. There were a lot of girls thinner than me that were not anorexic. There were also girls bigger than me who were anorexic. Yet, eating disorders are a mental game. A manic obsession with food so much so that every thought you have and every behaviour that you engage in revolves around food. No before and after pic can really convey just how much this disease consumed my life and left a path of destruction in its wake.  The little physical transformation that my body made only  makes my struggle with anorexia, my experience with the horrific disease and the handful of other mental illnesses that accompany it, seem unworthy. My illness was not physically drastic, and nor was my recovery. Thus, despite being recovered and living a life that did not seem possible five years ago, I am not what people would call ‘inspiring’. We continually harp on that “eating disorders are not about weight” yet in my newsfeed I see these transformation posts regularly. Just as it did when I was unwell, it still serves as a reminder that I was never really “sick enough.”  Yet who defines what exactly is sick enough? Five years ago, I was vomiting into my handbag after meals out. I was blacking out because my heart rate was so irregular. I spent most nights in my bed hacking up my arms and legs with razor blades. Five years ago, there were often times that the only option seemed to be to give up. There was nothing in this life worth living for and the pain was simply not worth it when the bad days far outnumbered the good. Despite all my greatest efforts, I would never be skeletal and I loathed that so much. I was bumped on and off waiting lists because more “drastic cases”  were prioritized. Back then, I didn’t feel worthy of recovery and now I don’t feel worthy of saying that I have recovered from an eating disorder.  There are no words to describe the happiness that exists in my life. The pure joy that comes from living each day. Social media is a blanketed moment in someone’s life, I know that and I try my hardest not to rate my worth on each post and each like that crosses my screen. I don’t need a transformation picture and a whole lot of comments for someone to tell me that I am inspiring. I know, deep down, that I have come out of the deepest depths of hell and it has made me the person that I love today.  







what i ate in New York pt 1 
~this is my recovery. it feels surreal to me that i actually did this. i flew half way around the world and ate foods i would have never been able to allow myself not even a few months ago. it’s hard to believe i was hospitalised just months before my trip. i’ve worked so hard for my freedom and i refuse to feel guilty for enjoying it.  

~ Real talk ~I don’t know why it has taken me so long to realize exactly how toxic counting calorie apps can be. That is where a lot of my disorder began in the first place and I am not sure why after 5ish years I decided it would be a good thing to go back to. If you have MyFitnessPal or a Fitbit app or some sort of tracker for your calorie intake delete it now. You’ll thank me later. At first, I thought tracking my calories and exercise was helping me. I somehow began to believe it was making me feel better. In some sort of way, I felt like it was justifying me being “allowed to eat”. I could eat if I stayed in “x” range. Okay, that was totally my disorder talking but I absolutely believed it. Today, I was feeling anxious and nervous bc of the interview I had this afternoon. It was hard for me to stay on target with hitting my three meals plus a snack goal bc my stomach was aching from nerves. It’s now 5:12 pm and my lack of intake has caught up to me and I’m exhausted! I bought a soft pretzel and a water on my way to the train bc it sounded good. I never eat pretzels anyway and it felt like the perfect snack. I sat down on a bench and waited for my trains arrival and began logging my calories for the day and realized that if I had this pretzel, I wouldn’t be able to have much for dinner. This is seriously no way to live. Of course I can have dinner. It’s part of my plan and promise to myself and therapist that I’ll try to meet my goals. Eating that pretzel was me listening to my body. That’s exactly what I’m supposed to be doing anyway! Learning to listen to hunger cues and not fucking ignoring them anymore. I’m a little proud of myself. I deleted the calorie counting app. It isn’t helping me. It’s fueling my ed and making me sad all the time bc I’m hungry trying to stay within these limits. Logically, I know I can always log the calories in my journal or in the notes on my phone but it’s not nearly as detailed or exact or compulsive. It’s just one more barrier in not having the app and maybe is exactly what I (and maybe you) need to lose the attachment to all of these numbers and rules. If you’re struggling with a similar thing, here’s a push to just delete the app. It might really help.  

hating your body is so pointless if you think about it

3 years ago today, almost to the minute, I was having my first mental breakdown in a Wetherspoons toilet in Canterbury, over having to add extra chicken to my plate. 
It was the first time I’d publicly broken down over food and the first time my family saw the extent of how ill I was. I weighed less than my little sister, I was verging on osteoporosis, my hair was thin and dry, I could barely walk round the shops. A month after this event I had a seizure due to my sugar levels being so low. 
That was 25th February 2015. It’s the 25th February 2018 now and I’m sat having spontaneous toast (a fear of mine), reading a book next to my beautiful girlfriend @dogs-and-recovery (who I met two years ago yesterday). Things aren’t great, but I’m at peace in this moment, I don’t know what the day holds but I’m not that scared of it anymore. I just drank a glass of orange juice without counting the calories. It’s going to be okay 

My constant headaches, extreme fatigue and my mind obsessing over food 24/7 keep me from passing my exams, from wanting to hang out with my friends , even from wanting to live at all. 

Flashback to the end of 2016. 
Fucking miss this body so much, even though I’m glad that I’m better now.. this was not pretty or livable anymore.
But now I’m fat.
✨INSTAGRAM: knicklichtparty✨ 

Today is my B-day and I woke up feeling horrible about myself, especially my body. So I was thinking - why do I feel this way? And my thoughts brought me to the very begining of all of my eating disorders and struggles.Yes, it all started online. I remember that fall evening very clearly. I found and watched the movie Starving in Suburbia - now don’t get me wrong, the movie itself is very good and doesn’t glorify disordered behaviours at all - but pro-ed people do. What caught my attention was the pro-ana chat group the movie showed. So my curious butt wanted to find something like that. And guess what, found. So I joined the chat. I wasn’t here with intention to lose weight, I just wanted to see. To see if people like that are really out there, encouraging themselves in self-destruction. Unfortunately for me, the people there were… nice to me. Or at least they acted it. It didn’t take long to persuade me to “join”. To be thin. To be beautiful. To be fighting with them.  Now, do you see how these “safe groups” are dangerous as hell? One stupid chat brought me to living nightmare. Of course then I joined tumblr. Some of my long-time followers may remember my blog before recovery. Yes, I was “pro-ana” blog (claiming that “this is my safe place”) and I am very ashamed of that and really sorry. Other pro-ana blogs were constantly triggering me, but the idea of me being a trigger never actually crossed my mind. Not until I decided to recover and realized how much damage I could have done. So I decided to change my content and delete all the sick stuff. I am not shaming any “pro-ana” bloggers, because I know where you are coming from. But I know that a lot of you are following me. And I want you to think. Think about your “safe place”. Is your “safe place” (that is actually not really safe) worth it? Think about the people visiting it. Think about the damage. How many people can get triggered by your posts and how many already got?Please, stay safe. Actually safe. 

Two years ago today I decided to fully commit to recovery.I committed to recovery with zero expectations. I was unable to imagine what a life without an eating disorder would be like. I was full of shame and self-hatred, and choosing recovery was a way for me to keep hold of a friendship. My friend guided my into it, and I was skeptical and scared, yet determined to give it my best.It was painful and hard at first–constantly. My stomach always hurt, my meals overwhelmed me, and my reflection made me cry. As the months went by, there were days of setbacks and days of victories; and slowly, through the ups and downs, I started wanting recovery for my own life.I started to get little glimpses of what life really is. My relationship with food was still disordered, but my life was no longer a gray blur. There were happy moments and present moments. I was starting to come to life.Today, I am alive. I live in the present, moment to moment. I’m currently thriving–healthy, happy, and strong. I am able to enjoy little moments in life; I am able to work through the difficult times, and I have a healthy relationship with food.Even if you don’t believe recovery is possible; if you fight, it can be. 

FabulousAttractiveTummy👏🌈💞 

in case you need any more proof that women’s clothing sizes mean absolutely nothing (and I doubt you do), then you should know that ALL OF THESE FIT ME PERFECTLY 

 

Its okay to eat🌈💖 

Just sent this to a friend of mine (talking about weight restoration) but it’s something I really need to remember:Gaining equals laughter, spontaneous meals out with friends and family, ice creams out in the sun, concentration to read and study, food freedom, energy, curves, and boobs and a bum, clothes that fit, running, university, babies, holidays, a career, takeaways with friends, fajhita nights, a Christmas dinner, cake on my birthday, going out clubbing, visiting new places, travelling… It equals a life worth living. Recovery from an eating disorder may be centered around gaining WEIGHT but really it should be called gaining LIFE.  

 

PEG update 
My PEG tube started bleeding a lot yesterday and still has been a little today. 
And my life is falling apart. Today, CB said “God, you look awful” and I had no idea how to even respond. 
But in other news, I got these today!!! They are pads for my G tube!

Suicide Prevention Month day 1: IT GETS BETTER.
The first picture is of me at age seven, which is when I first began to experience suicidal ideation. I had severe depression/anxiety/PTSD as a result of abuse from my biological family, and my desire to die stemmed from that. Looking back, it is horrifically tragic that I wanted to kill myself at such a young age –but at the time (and in the many years that followed), my death wish felt perfectly rational. After all, for my whole life, things had only gotten worse as far as my family’s treatment of me and my emotional state. By the time I was 19 and left my biological family, I had been suicidal for over a decade, and had actually attempted more than once. And even once I was free from the abuse, things were STILL bad – I was on my own in the world with no family to fall back on or come home to, I was struggling to get proper medical treatments and work/pay bills, and I wanted to die more than ever. At this point, it felt like I had every reason to give up and end it all, because never in my life had things ever gotten much “better”. I thought I had every reason to kill myself – but there was one big thing stopping me: hope. 
Even in my absolute worst moments, when no other person was there for me, I had my hope. I had the little voice inside of me that whispered “keep going”, and the tiny flicker of light that refused to be overpowered by the overwhelming dark. I had my hope, and nothing could take that away from me. So I held on to that small flame, and fanned it until it became a raging fire. I reached out to friends and professionals for support, I advocated for myself, and I fought like hell against everything in the world and in my mind that wanted to hold me back. When depression shouted at me to kill myself, I shouted even louder that I was going to keep living. Even with shaking hands and tears in my eyes, I stood up and pressed onward because deep down, I had faith that one day, it would get better – and get better it did.
The second picture is of me today. Today, where I still struggle at times, but am no longer suicidal. I no longer want to die, because despite everything that ever held me down, I finally built a life that I would consider 100% worth living. Things finally began to look up for me, even in the face of everything bad I had been through. A couple of months ago, a friend I reached out to put me in contact with a really amazing couple, who talked about adopting me into their family – and shortly after, that discussion became a reality when I moved to California to be with them. Not long after arriving here, I got the puppy I’d always wanted (to go along with the safe, loving family I’d dreamed of) and started seeing a very skilled therapist to work on the things I still struggle with. Soon, I will be starting college classes and taking music lessons to pursue the things I’m really passionate about. Overall, my life is full of love and joy, and I would not trade it for the world. 
And the thing is, none of this would have happened if I had not kept living. None of this would have been possible had I at any point gone all the way and actually killed myself. Had that happened, I would have been dead, and my story would have gotten that tragic ending instead of the happy one it has now. I guess what I am getting at here in this novel of a post is that IT GETS BETTER, but in order for that to happen, you have to LIVE. So please, if you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, do not give in. There IS hope, and a there IS light at the end of the tunnel. All you have to do is keep fighting in order to get there. 💙 

I’ve had the BEST 24HRS EVER!!
I caught a train to an outlet centre by myself (!!!!) and met up with my closest friends from inpatient! I was admitted on the same day as Charlotte and we were the first ED patients there for ages. And then Megan came along and we became really close. 8 months later and we reunited! 
I remember when Charlotte and I cried together because there was a side of rice with dinner. And how we all freaked out when a group of other ED patients were admitted. But yesterday we had a spontaneous lunch out at Wagamama, and had dinner at Wetherspoons and we were okay! There wasn’t any competition or tension at meals, we just all got along with it. I admit I freaked out internally after lunch as I had packed a bunch of safe foods which I planned to have but when the other two went out I decided to challenge myself too. I couldn’t order dessert but I shared Sam’s and it was more than my usual three bites so I was really proud of myself. I didn’t buy anything but we played a game of ‘find the ugliest thing you can and try it on’ and I found those huge satin pink trousers which was a look 
We went home and played Cards Against Humanity, a board game and then we decided to be Donna and The Dynamos (yes I bloody love Mama Mia), so we found just dance videos on YouTube and filmed ourselves. We joked so much about mental illness and it was so funny, and we talked about the ward like we couldn’t do wen we were there. It was absolutely hilarious. They stayed the night and they’re gone now but honestly it was amazing I’m so happy and SO SO PROUD OF MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗

I realised that I WANT to live, just not with my ED. So if I don’t want me dead, and don’t want my anorexia (fuck that bitch) so I NEED to recover. This is that simple. I want to feed my body and kill my sickness, not feed my sickness and kill my body.please reblog, if u dont want to recover, I feel bad for u, but it may help others 

 

PLEASE CAN EVERYONE HELP THIS ANON (AND ME) OUT AND LIKE/REBLOG THIS POST IF YOU ARE A RECOVERY BLOG (OR IF YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS) FOR BLOGS/PEOPLE TO FOLLOW WHO ARE A LITTLE FURTHER ALONG IN THEIR JOURNEYS. THANKS XOp.s. you are not troubling me in the slightest, I am more than happy to try to help x 

There is a point in recovery, when the wins feel like losses and barely anyone is left clapping because you’ve tackled a fear you’ve food you’ve had for years. You no longer feel like rewarding yourself because you’re not sure whether you believe in what you’re doing anymore.There is a point in recovery that feels so mind numbingly boring because you are no longer in the depths of your illness (and yes, it is an illness) but you have not yet reached optimum health. No one is watching you anymore. You think it’ll be easy to slip back into old habits.So listen up, it will be long and it will be painful. It will often be harder than being in the depths of your eating disorder (I promise the belief you were not ‘sick enough’ is your disorder talking) and it will feel like it is never ending. Push through it. You don’t have to believe me. You don’t have to listen to me. But you’re close. You’re so close to life you can almost touch it.Reach out.   

my mom coming home from work after being gone all day: have you eaten today?me: yesalso me: 

139/365 

And for the first time in a long time I am more tired than proud of being sick. I no longer wear it proudly it like a medal, I am tired of having to say no to things and all these habits I have fallen into. It is more painful than exciting.  

That is a HUGE accomplishment!! I’m so proud of you! Keep fighting and honor yourself for those successes <3 

This morning I decided to weigh in again for the first time in almost a month. I’m at 67,8 kilograms. I expected myself to have a mental breakdown right then and there, but you know what?
I’m actually quite okay with it right now. I am at a healthy weight. I am not fat. I have fat. There’s a difference. And no, I am not magically cured now but each and every one of these moments where I would usually experience a huge relapse, where I now feel kinda okay, are a win. And that’s what I need to remember. 

Have you ever seen a dead bird, one that’s just been killed? It still has feathers, wings, a beak, the shape and color of a bird. But somehow it looks different. Somehow it looks small and heavy and creepy, nothing like the light singing blossom it was when it was alive. Things look different when they’re still. We don’t just see the shape of things. We see them as living and changing beings. Movement makes a difference in the beauty of something. Remember that, the next time you’re standing still, scrutinizing your body in the mirror. You were not meant to be a freeze-frame. You were meant to fly.  

AdmittedI got admitted to the hospital. Again. I am so exhausted. This is truly miserable. I HAVE to get better. I have to. And I might scream if one more nurse says how emaciated, malnourished, or tiny I am. 😓.

I don’t know how many of/if any of my followers are Jewish, but for anyone observing Yom Kippur and in ED recovery right now:Please eat. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for eating (This goes for everyone in ED recovery actually!)Eating on Yom Kippur is not a reflection of  who you are as a Jew. You’re supposed to live by the commandments, not die by them.I know this is the Day of Atonement, but please don’t let it feed into any struggles you may already have with guilt, self criticism, feeling overly responsible for others, feelings of worthlessness, feeling like you’re not enough, feeling like you’re too much, or any other cruel thoughts your mental illness sends towards you.Taking care of yourself is an important part of Tzedek and Tikkun Olam. You have to heal yourself before you can heal the world.  

The gap between my thighs might not exist anymore but it has been replaced with energy, a personality, and so much love to give 

• It might not look like a big deal for you - but for me, this meal was a lot. 
• Work was super hectic today and my boss offered to give everyone lunch on him. I chose something challenging because I knew if I didn’t like it, I wouldn’t feel bad because I didn’t have to pay for it. 
• Above is a spinach wrap filled with grilled chicken, an onion ring, jalapeños, shredded cheddar and buffalo BBQ sauce. I got a side of cheese fries and pasta salad. 
• I have avoided wraps for a few years now. Idk why, but tortillas are a fear but now they’re becoming easier to eat than a roll so I figured I might as well try them again and honestly, this was one of the best wraps I have ever had!! The cheese fries were ok. The cheese was a lil weird but I finished all my fries and had half a wrap and finished the other half for dinner. 
• I’m proud of myself. Today was awesome. No regrets. I didn’t look up calories of anything in the meal besides the cheese whiz and I knew how many calories were in one onion ring and I didn’t let it break me. I usually would ask for no cheese on a wrap like this but I went ahead and did it and conquered!!! 
• I challenge you warriors to have something you wouldn’t usually have this weekend. Let me know how it goes! 

I came to these tags looking for positivity and support. I sure as shit don’t want to know about your safe foods, nor do I want to want to hear about your weight loss progress, nor do I want to see your thinspo.Just fucking stop. 

When a friend of a friend is saying inaccurate, stereotypical, insulting things about people with eating disorders but I don’t feel comfortable calling them on their bullshit because drama could ensue and I hate conflict 

43 months Anorexia recovery 🌷 

I made a decision. Hello fellows. Let’s get to the point because i have much to say about this topic. I don’t want to be anna or be obcessed with my weight anymore. Do you know why ? Because i’ve been hurting my real friends, my family , they notice that i’m turning into a depressed skeleton. If i keep with this mentality i’ll die in a couple of days. I don’t want to hurt people who love me even more. I don’t want to be selfish. What’s the point to be so skinny as a skeleton ? I wouldn’t make anyone proud , i can’t give up on my academical formation as a person for achieve a stupid goal weight that possible might kill me. Any of you guys know how much cost a treatment if you got hospitalized for collapse without nutrients?? Above 200 euros (in portugal) . I don’t want that for my family that treatment is so fucking expensive.. The money is important to pay my bills for the house and my college, to buy some books, to buy clothes, makeup wtv, not to be hospitalized in the verge of death.. I don’t want to be a living death person anymore. I almost feel that i’ve no soul anymore. I’m avoidying everyone in my real life. I feel so lonely.. I choose to live. I have so many things to give in this life ! Enough of this ridiculous life. Enough to worry everyone. I want to fight for my future life . It’s stupid fight for being death !! Think about that all the anorexic/suicidal girls. Learn to enjoy life. Don’t let the voices in your head and all the ppl who hurt you be victorious. You have to fight you have to live you all deserve to be happy . I’ll start my recovery. I’m tired to be in pain for eight years of anorexic and bulimic life. Im seeking for help , i want to become a normal girl again fullfiled with energie and knowlege. Goodbye anna, goodbye bulimia. Fuck you  .l. .l. .l. i’m stronger than you! 

Happiness is not a size💐💖

I DID IT 





Big big fear food challenge: bakery goods without knowing and counting calories. White bread, cheese, sugar and sweet sauces.. All of this screams don’t eat it.
BUT GUESS WHAT ANA, I DID 🐝✨ 

Hello everyone! Sorry I’ve been so inactive recently, I hope you’re all well.
I think I owe you guys a bit of an update, so here goes..
I’m doing GOOD! I think I’ve hit a turning point in my recovery, and I now feel so much stronger and more like myself - it’s actually incredible. I barely even have eating-disordered thoughts anymore, not that I notice anyway, and I almost never use behaviours. Anxiety-wise, things are still tough - I still struggle a lot with feelings and my core belief of ‘not being good enough’, which then filters out into quite a lot of my life without me noticing! However, my therapist and I are planning to work extra hard on this during my last few months at camhs before I go to uni.
I’ve now finished school, and I’m done with my one exam (a crash higher in human biology) which I think went okay, but we’ll just have to wait and see I guess..! I’m really excited for uni, and I feel like I’m in a place where I will be able to manage on my own, which I’m proud of myself for achieving - I honestly didn’t think I’d ever get to where I am today.
I know summer can be difficult for many of us with eating disorders, but please know you’re not alone and you can always come and talk to me if you need to!
Keep fighting, I promise you it will be worth it.
Love, Hannah xxx 

6 simple words that have so much meaning; in honor of NEDA week, I invite you all to keep this poem in your head. Recovery and life is a journey, a process, and it will have its highs and lows. You may not always like who you are, what your body looks like, etc. but you have to accept what you cannot change. It’s not easy, you may hate every moment of it, but there’s no other way. Somedays you may have moments where you more than accept yourself, you actually love yourself. Live for those movements, they may it all worth it 

The reality of inpatient - The majority of people with mental health problems, whether that’s an eating disorder, depression, a personality disorder or something specific else, will be treated in the community. If you haven’t been inpatient, that does not in any way suggest that you are not ill or deserving of help.- It’s not straight jackets and padded walls. If anyone really thinks that this is what a CAMHS unit is like (I haven’t been in an adult ward so can’t comment on that) then it’s very wrong!! There are documentaries about them or you can just google some to see what they’re like but really they don’t feel very clinical. Sure, there’s nothing dangerous and there’s nurses and doctors and medication, but there’s also tv and blankets and laughing.- Getting there is terrifying. Almost everyone flips out at first, what is this place? Who are they? What are the other patients like? What do I do? It’s so new and different and scary but this usually comes then passes quite quickly.- It won’t cure you. The purpose of inpatient is to stabilise, not cure. Nobody comes out completely recovered, it just doesn’t happen and to expect this for yourself is setting yourself up to fail. Equally a lot of family or friends expect that when someone is discharged they should be ‘fine’. This is harmful and can lead to people hiding how they feel.- It’s not real life. No glass, no sharps, no time alone, no expectations, it isn’t false. And this can be really helpful when people need a break from life but it also gives people a false sense of security and doesn’t test whether they can actually cope in the real world which leads on to my next point…- Leaving is hard. And people who haven’t been inpatient wont understand this but it’s something that so many patients face and are shocked by. Think about it, you’ve practically lived somewhere for months with people you get close to and trust, people who may have even saved your life and suddenly you’re being told you’ll never see them again. Back to reality. Back to school and work and responsibilities and hardest of all, back to the place where you became so unwell. 

Natural remedies for mental illness are not superior to medication. Medication is not superior to natural remedies. Do what works best for you.  

“We cannot control life by controlling what we eat.” - Nigella Lawson 

Me: *has a small snack after fasting for 72 hours*ED:  

so I told my mom that I wanted ice cream earlier (especially since I had already eaten very little today so I was super hungry). she then went to the store and bought ice cream. I told her not to (because it’s a fear food) but she did anyway.after crying a bunch, I ate the whole little cup. granted it had a bunch of calories and it really freaked me out, I managed to make it through. I’m trying not to let the guilt sink in too much, especially since its almost 1am and I have no idea what we’re eating tomorrow but oh well. I’ll live, right? Haha well that was my little recovery win: eating Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from blue bunny 💛😊 

My grandma hugged me like a billion times before she left our house after the holiday. “Keep getting better,” she told me, “you’re getting there.”My grandma’s not a very emotional person but her words kind of hit me. My family just wants me to get better. None of the people who love me cares one little bit if I’m skinny. No one who cares about me thinks that eating fewer calories makes me strong. They don’t care what I look like or what rules I follow. They believe that I’m worth being healthy. I wish I could see myself through their eyes.  

What are some things that you wish treatment providers were more aware of when treating LGBTQ+ people with eating disorders? 



Anorexia:
                                                ".... to the bone."                    

EDNOS, b/p, bulimia, etc :
                                                ...to the bone and back - to the bone and back - to the bone and back to th

The hardest part of recovery is realizing that “recovered” doesn’t mean “the same as you were before.” 



Skinny aesthetic  

today my ED was very loud, telling me to skip breakfast and enjoy the hunger and feeling of control again. I might be going out for dinner so why would I need food now? but I stepped up, said fuck you to ana, and made some toast. 
I really want to recover 

The sickness is not in your new lowest weight or a confirmed diagnosis. The sickness is in the way you’re abusing your body and believe that it’s okay. 

Just accepted an UNCONDITIONAL OFFER TO MEDICINE!!!! This is the best day of my life 😭 just giving me so much more motivation to recover. I’m going to be a doctor!!

Strong wildflower vibes today! Breakfast is happily in my tummy, meeting a friend for shopping then a meal with my mom 😶
Also got lots of bits for tidying/ decorating my room! New duvet set, lamp, candle holders and maybe some more things today? Having a clear room is so so helpful for me and I’ve been putting this off for too long.
Also bought a bowl and plate which I’m going to decorate with my porcelain pen as motivation!!!!
Good mood Sunday 😇💪🏻 

Be like a tree.                                                      Stay grounded.                                            Connect with your roots.

YES YES YES YES!! I completely agree. Thank you for this submission! My dietitian drilled this into my head for years, and I’ve only just now started to accept it as fact. Everything contains some form of nutrition. Guilt is something the diet industry has drilled into our heads, and it’s bullshit. 

Eating Disorders in People of colorEven today I’m still trying to get what I am. People look at me and tell me I am a person of color… which is weird because my whole life I grew up thinking I was white. My mom is white, I was raised among kids in a private school mostly white. I saw only white people in movies and tv. It never occurred to me.I remember when I went in to be evaluated for an eating disorder, they asked me why I wanted so much to be thin… I said because then I wouldn’t look like a chubby Latina anymore… but like a white woman. A white woman who has class and a chance out there..In a way, racism shaped my eating disorder… 

‪Life seems to hurt a lot more at night‬ 

Nobody : Ana : you are too fat to be anorexic 

LEMME TELL YOU ’BOUT THIS BODY YALLThis body does important shit. It takes me to my job to watch two wonderful little humans. It takes me to my internship to help people with their inner lives. It holds my brain, which gives me the knowledge I need to do well in school. These arms give people the warmest hugs. These legs take me on walks, and sometimes even runs. These cheeks show off my dimples and my joy. This belly holds my internal organs that do a great job chugging away day after day. This body, y’all. It’s the only one I get. And yeah, some days I feel a helluva lot of discomfort in wearing this skin suit, but y’know, it’s not all bad. It’s really not. AND SOMEDAY (maybe not today but someday) IM GONNA GET A DAMN GOOD POEM OUT OF HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS WONDERFUL BODY 

MY CONSTANT THOUGHTS ABOUT FOOD ARE GONEMY CONSTANT THOUGHTS ABOUT FOOD ARE GONEMY CONSTANT THOUGHTS ABOUT FOOD ARE GONE!!!!!!!!!!!! 

 

The perfect post-dinner distraction…I’ve been struggling to let myself do things like this for a while but today I was having a bad day, feeling very tired, feeling very unfocused, wondering what the point in everything was etc. and instead of succumbing to these thoughts I started knitting a scarf. There’s nothing like repetitive motion to shut your brain up. I’ve been planning on doing this for a while as my friend’s birthday is in a less than a couple of months which is giving me a good excuse to do something crafty (not that I should need an excuse).

                j.m.n            


It wasn’t until November when I was
admitted to a mental hospital because I was afraid to give in to my
suicidal thoughts and couldn’t eat anything at all that I finally
realized what anorexia is. 
Until then I assumed I was actually a
stupid, ugly, childish, worthless, embarrassing failed excuse of a
human being. 
It wasn’t a thought that made me think
so, it was a feeling rooting from my soul ever since I was 12 years
old. It was so natural that I took it for granted and didn’t question
it. Everytime someone said they liked me I thought they were just
being sweet, because feelings aren’t wrong, are they?It was the feeling that made me hate
myself for everything I am. 
It was the feeling that made me starve
and hide myself in baggy clothes because the less I was, the better. 
It was the feeling that made me feel
embarrassed about having a crush on someone. 
It was the feeling that made me adjust
myself so much that anyone barely noticed me. 
It was the feeling that made me lose my
friends. 
It was the feeling that made me wish I
was mentally disabled to be unaware of my personality. 
The therapists in the treatment center
I was last summer told me to be kind to myself, but even the thought
made me sick. How could I possibly love myself if I can’t even stand
myself? 
It wasn’t until November that I figured
out my self-hatred is an illness. 
Since then I am finally okay with
trying to like myself. 
I am enough. I am okay. And you are,
too. You deserve to live. You deserve to make peace with your past. You deserve to fulfill your needs. It’s anorexia that makes you hate
yourself. ♥♥♥ 

PEG tube surgery is over and CB cuddled with me in my hospital bed until the anesthesia wore off. 
 

Selfie Sunday ft. a pic from Friday because you can bet I did not put a lick of makeup on today!!! 

I’m So TrIgGeRrEdDon’t you just love when you’re underweight (BMI of 15.6) but then when you want to recover and talk about gaining weight, someone tells you that no you don’t and they’d rather be your weight than what they are now.And how when people see how thin you are they want to be like you and not know all the complications that are along with that?Like ???¿¿¿¿Life is so hard 😭 like I wanna get better but guess not anymore huh 🤷‍♀️ 

Here’s a list I like to call “Things People Say That Piss Me Off”:1. “You’re at a healthy weight now, you must be recovered?”2. “I don’t understand why you can’t just eat it, it’s just food.”3. “Maybe if you just eat, you’ll feel better.”4. “You don’t look like you have an eating disorder.”The list goes on, but that’s just a, hence the pun, “taste test” of phrases I dislike.Yes, I’m at a healthy weight.Yes, I usually have my 3 meals a day with snacks in between.Yes, I eat out with friends now.But that’s on my good days.No one knows what it’s like, mentally. Whether I am having a good or a bad day, I can’t look at food the same. I don’t remember a time where I wouldn’t count calories.I still walk into the hamburger shop, and feel nauseous at the thought of how many calories are in my food. I still prefer to have skim milk in my lattes. I still prefer to stray away from high fat foods, although my therapist encourages my family to expose to me to these Siobhan-proclaimed “dangerous” foods. I still get anxiety in situations which involve food.I hope, whoever is reading this, if you are battling an eating disorder - Your weight does not determine how mentally ill you are. I can’t stress this enough. Don’t get me wrong, you are so, so beautiful, no matter what weight you are, but just because you’re at a “healthy” weight, it doesn’t discriminate the disordered thoughts in your head. Hell, the disordered thoughts I have now are worse than when I was at my lowest.Recovery is hard. But we can get through this together.xx Siobhan

Promised my nan I would eat with her and I did!
Feels like a huge amount and I saw my stomach in the mirror afterwards which was awful but hey ho got to accept this is the way forward. Also embarrassed about posting such a large volume of food but shut up head it’s bloody salad and I did it for her. 
My tutors asked about yesterday and I told them how much it motivated me to make changes, one of them made me promise her to keep eating and said I’m doing well. So positive today!
Bought her flowers and a special jammy dodger cheesecake because my nan is 😇 and we’ve decided next time I see her we’re doing some baking which we haven’t done for years!  

Okay so this is a very impromptu post but I thought I’d share it because it’s such a big milestone…I got my period for the first time in eight months!And I ain’t even gonna censor this or anything because periods are normal and need be talked about in relation with ED’s.It might not seem big to everyone, but it’s big for me because it means that I’m fertile; my ED hasn’t taken away my chance to have children of my own (one of the shittest possibilities whilst having anorexia) in the future. I’m and incredibly happy- but in pain. Oh well. I don’t mind this time.  

My thoughts (spoilers)
 • I thought they gave awareness on a risky topic the right way 
• Although some may see it as “glamorizing” eating disorders it addressed the awful parts of it (such as Ellen/Eli staring death right in the face, Megan losing her child, etc.)
• It was kept diverse however I think it very easily could have used more diversity 
• It showed many different body types including what looked to be overweight, Normal, underweight, and anorexic based on what people immediately judge 
• Based on the fact that they were all in an in-patient program they all were dealing with eating disorders and it gave the illness a sense of reality in how it affects different people and body types
• It strayed away from the “love them back to health” thing. Ellen/Eli pushed Luke away and didn’t let him love her and he didn’t love her back to health 
• All in all it was a very good way of addressing eating disorders by showing the bad parts of it and how unhealthy they are 
• Side note: a major plot point was that a girl killed herself because of her drawings displayed on social media (specifically Tumblr) which contributed to her eating disorder. This shows just how big of a deal it can be to be careful with social media 
 • I want a sequel 

“You don’t look like you have an eating disorder,” they say. 
“What does that mean?” I say to myself. 
That’s when the self destructive thoughts start to intrude.
Am I not starving myself enough? 
Am I not thin enough?
Am I not good enough?
Am I not in control?
What can I do to prove to you the guilt I associate with eating certain foods?
Do I need to walk around with a sign above my head saying “Don’t Feed Me”?
Do I need to go to the bathroom after every meal because I “don’t feel well”? 
Do I need to restrict every single meal?
Do I need to remind you how I was in hospital for a month because my heart was failing on me?
“Thanks,” I end up saying back to them, “I guess I don’t look like it at all.”
The severity of my disordered eating is not determined by how much I weigh. 
xx Siobhan 

For making me so afraid to see the number on the scale rise, that I’m  dehydrated and weak from restricting food and liquids of any kind.

It’s there😍 I ordered a snack box full of tasty surprises from The Go Foods Company. There are so many amazing snacks in there and I can’t wait to try them🐝✨💕 



I’m just so very v e r y

These are so very comfy. I never want to take them off!!

I’m having a rough day, so I decided to tell ED exactly how I feel in the form of alphabet fries 

Barely passed 1k today. I’m going to eat something fatty and sugary that I’m not supposed to eat. I need to pack as many calories into as little volume as possible right now. Already feel like I’ll be ill if I eat any more but I freaking mowed today, I can’t eat only 1k.

calorieless flavoured water
i thought other anas may like this, too.
so, there’s something called MiO water enhancer and it’s delicious. there’s two types;
there’s multiple flavours for both types, too.
sticking true to my word too, they both have no calories !! here’s the thing for the regular kind ( ignore my fat hands ) ;
and here’s thing for the sports;
i usually put like,, four squirts into my water and it’s got lots of flavour. it can serve up to 24 servings too !
they’re relatively cheap and are available at grocery stores, gas stations, anywhere.
stay safe ( or idk do what u want ) 💛 





Photos from the past few days to prove that even the absolute darkest times will have rays of light 🌄 

I was craving cake so I had a piece of cake? crazy??? who am I?? 

lunch - roasted sweet potatoes, cauliflower gnocchi with chili flakes, curry chickpeas, peas, hummus, and almond ricotta!  

TWi honestly didn’t think i’d make it to 16 years old, hell i didnt even think i’d make it to my gcse exams but here i am!! i’ve done 5 of my exams so far and i feel ok! Mentally i feel like i’m slipping - exams are keeping me occupied for now but i don’t see it lasting long. i’m trying to enjoy the moment and think of the future but anorexia is so webbed into my mind that i dont even feel like myself anymore, i can’t remember the food i enjoy because i’ve been denied it for so long - when i think about what i eat it’s like re-reading the same books over and over again; i know every word, every detail and i can’t change that, something new is something scary and something that will of course inevitably make me fattoday i tried to test myself, i had a normal sized lunch and then desert and i’ve also had some birthday cake! it doesnt feel like a step towards a recovery mindset because i’ve been terrified of this day for weeks and i’ve still counted every calorie. i’m just not in the right mindset - i dont want to change, i feel comforted and in control with knowing what i’m putting in my body. to me it doesnt even really feel like a problem because its so engraved into me! sure i think about pizza but it’s like common sense to me that i cant have it; there’s no debating or wishing i could have it because it just seems practical not to.i don’t know what will happen next for me, finish my gcse’s and then what? i know i’ll likely get hospitaised sooner or later but i just dont care enough about myself to fight anymore - the old me has gone and anorexia has finally taken over.

                A Goodbye Letter To My Eating Disorder | j.m.n            


everyone: “are you sure you want to eat that? It’s kind of unhealthy”me, who is trying to recover & has managed to eat something each day without crying over calories and/or weight:Originally posted by comeinwiththemilk 





Hidden ribs
All I’m wanting is just to be a bit less fat
That’s all
Why’s it so hard??
~ ☆ 

Some advice for my young followersHello friends! So I’m 21 (still quite young), but I’m a senior in college so I’m going to begin my Real Life Adulthood in a few months. Mainly I’m aiming this at people in highschool or the early parts of college.If you suspect you are mentally ill, get help. Talk to someone you trust if you’re too young to go on your own. Find a therapist if you have the ability to. I know that sounds pretty basic, BUT, you’re only this young once. I lost so much of my teenage years to depression, anxiety, and my eating disorder. And I also lost a LOT of my college experience. This age is so unique because you have the ability to explore the freedoms of adulthood while not yet having all of its responsibilities (mainly a family or a career).This website can be REALLY harmful to recovery unless you’re careful. I’m looking at the posts that say things like “if you’re suicidal/have self harm urges/etc you’re valid” because yeah, while your experience is real, it’s not one you want to keep having.You’re going to have a lot of slips and bumps on the road to getting better. It’s not easy. But motivating yourself with “I can’t waste my life on this” might light enough of a fire under your butt to keep yourself going. Basically, what I’m saying is that you should keep working really hard at recovery. This is coming from someone who missed out on so much because I kept isolating myself to stay sick. Take back your youth. 

So I’m in a good place and really feeling myself and my recovery. TW in advance for eating disorders and anorexia cause I’m mobile without a cut and I will be posting selfies. Also in one I’m in a bikini so if you’re uncomf, keep scrolling. I’m posting this here instead of my main because I have a history of attracting The Worst there
Here are some pics of me from 2012


I stopped growing at about 15 and I was 17 (maybe 18) in these photos. I’m 6 feet tall when I stand up properly. At my lowest, I was about 215/220 lbs because I was obsessed with weighing 180 and having a “healthy BMI” according to Wii fit
I wish I was joking
Look how rail thin I am in picture one. That blonde girl on my right was a foot shorter than me and our thinness levels are pretty similar. Let that sink in
I was almost as thin as my 5 foot friend at 6 feet tall
Obviously unhealthy. Now let’s look at some recent selfies


I HAVE! A BODY!!!
LOOK AT THAT
There’s actual flesh! My body in pic one is pretty average! Yeah I’m built a little more like a linebacker or a fridge but I have really broad shoulders so my fat distribution is a bit different from what you might expect. I have mass!
Just comparing my face like before, my eyes were sunken and soulless. There’s no light reflected at all. But in the suit selfie despite pulling a :| face because I was focused on my makeup, light reflects. There’s soul there. There’s substance rather than exhaustion
You can still see my facial structure but no longer can you outline my bones. Honestly that’s probably the most disturbing to me. You can directly trace the physical bones of my face I was so thin
I’m! So! Proud! Of! Myself!
I’m at about 306 now which is almost 100 lbs heavier than I was. It’s also been 7 years since I was at my lowest point. I was 100% on a trajectory towards death. You can see it in my eyes, in the fact that I wouldn’t smile. Like I know the three comparison pics I chose aren’t a good reflection of that but like here are two recent selfies of me making actual facial expressions


Scrolling through my selfie album on Facebook, I slowly smile more and make more facial expressions. I’m still partial to the :| for showing off glasses/hair/makeup but more and more there’s soul to what I post. It’s less filtered to look aesthetically pleasing and more real to life
Just. I’m really proud of myself. My doctor brought up dieting in our last appointment and I’m not doing it. I’m not giving this up for anything. I’m so much happier, so much healthier than I was. I’m not going to give into fatphobic diet culture and restrict calories. Sure I’ll do the hard work of making sure I’m getting enough protein and other nutrients. But I’m not going back to restriction for restriction’s sake
I’m just. Really proud of myself and my recovery and wanted to share that somewhere safe. I’ve had a LOT of crap in the past from people who don’t know me sending triggering asks or belittling me for triggering others on my main blog. Thus why it’s not posted there
But like I really wanted to share this with you guys! Recovery IS possible! It’s really really hard and progress isn’t linear. Relapses happen. But I’m in remission and continuing towards (potential) full recovery
Whatever y'all are dealing with, whatever badness is plaguing you, I promise you can overcome it. It’s taken me 7 years to finally start eating like an adult instead of a coma patient but it’s happening! I’m doing it!
Feel free to reblog these btw! They/them/their 



Today is No Diet Day! A day to bring awareness and stop perpetuation of diet culture. The truth is, diets don’t work. More than 95% of dieters will regain the weight they lost. Oftentimes, people gain back even more. When deprived, the body goes into survival mode, craving what you’ve been restricting and leading to binges. Only when we ditch the diet and relearn how to listen to our bodies can true food freedom (and mental freedom!) be found. There is SO MUCH more to life than losing weight.

FUCKI was sending memes to my friend in bulk and accidentally sent her this one AND NOW SHES ASKING WHAT ED MEANS AND I CANT TELL HER CAUSE SHE’LL BE CONCERNED THE IRONY OH MY 

💛💛💛 

I’m sickSo I caught the viral that’s currently going around in my area. It’s pretty much just a stomach bug so I am pretty nauseous and hopefully I won’t throw up at all.No matter how sick I was with my ed whenever I caught something bad like this viral I would stop my diet and switch to something else.This diet is for sick people and its called B.R.A.T, it stands for banana, rice, applesauce and toast. So next time you get sick please try it, even if it’s just half a banana, or a small bit of toast. Nausea sucks, and many of you will use it not to eat, but when your sick you need food for your body to fight off the virus.Love you all and stay hydrated!—-Je suis maladeJ'ai donc attrapé le virus qui circule actuellement dans ma région.  C'est à peu près juste un mal de ventre, alors j'ai la nausée et j'espère que je ne vomirai pas du tout.Peu importe à quel point j'étais malade à cause de mon trouble de l'alimentation chaque fois que j'attrapais quelque chose de mauvais comme ce virus, j'arrêtais mon régime et je passais à autre chose.Ce régime est destiné aux personnes malades et s'appelle B.R.A.T. Il signifie banane, riz, compote de pommes et toast. La prochaine fois que vous tombez malade, essayez-le, même s'il ne s'agit que d'une demi-banane ou d'un petit toast.  Les nausées craignent, et beaucoup d'entre vous ne s'en servent pas pour manger, mais quand vous êtes malade, vous avez besoin de nourriture pour que votre corps puisse combattre le virus.Je vous aime tous, restez hydratés!(Désolé si l'un de mes Français se trompe! Je me suis beaucoup entraîné récemment, mais je ne suis pas parfait.) 

I’m curious if anyone in eating disorder recovery  with OCD has had a similar experience to me. Since becoming more active and true to my recovery, I feel like my OCD is exponentially worse than it was when I was engaging in my eating disorder. I’m on sertraline which supposed to be really good for helping OCD but I feel like the obsessive thoughts  haven’t decreased at all. Does anyone think there could be correlation between giving up ed behaviors and channeling some of that energy into OCD behaviors? Idk if that’s a thing but yeah, looking for some answers!  

shoutout to ppl with:-very round tums-tums that roll when you sit or bend over-tums that always have rolls-tums with cellulite or stretch marks-tums with large rib cages -tums that have outtie belly buttons-tums that have innie belly buttons-tums that sit over your pants just a wee bit-tums with scars that are either from self-harm or an operation/surgery of some sortyour tummy is cute and very important and there is no need to be ever be ashamed of it.   

Actually, most of my wardrobe is tie dye 
 

you know what absolutely sucks? i’ve never been in a relationship because i’ve always been “the fat girl” and i honestly don’t think anyone will fall in love with me until i finally lose the weight. yea, i still want “that” body but i want someone to fall in love with me even more. this makes me feel 100000x worse after a binge. i’m ruining my chances of ever finding love, or even being in a relationship. that really fucking hurts and i KNOW it’s all me. it’s MY fault. 

“Conversations” with the inner demons (TRIGGER WARNING)Depression: SAD SAD SAD SADSADSADSADSAD S A D.Me: Okay I get it–Depression: SAD SAD SAD SADMe: You can stop shouting now–Depression: I AM SADAnxiety: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHMe: Why are you screaming??Anxiety: AHHHHHHHHHMe: Is there even a threat?Anxiety: YESMe: What is it?Anxiety: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHAnorexia (the meanest of the bunch): Hey so you’re a fat, ugly, worthless slut, and if you eat today you deserve to die in a hole because no one will ever love you if you eat.Me: Excuse me?Anorexia: I SAID I HATE YOU.Self-Harm: You know what’d feel really good right now?Me: Masturbating?Self-Harm: No I was going to say that you should dig your nails into your forearms until you draw blood.Me: How does that–Self-Harm: DO IT.

My anaconda don’t want none unless you got Cinnabon🐍 





Easter was full of challenges, I had a roast dinner comprising many elements, when currently one of my main fears is having too ‘many’ foods at once, it’s very overwhelming. Secondly, as my British pals will know, it was v hot. I’ve been struggling massively with my body image and was determined to stay in jeans and long sleeves, but nah-ah. LOOK WHO WORE SHORTS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SO LONG! I was so proud of myself, and in breaking that rule I was able to enjoy a lovely seaside trip with Sam and their little brother.
I’m back at uni now. I was quite worried because we don’t have any more lectures so there isn’t much structure, and also less activity, which makes eating more difficult. I’m also worried because I’m seeing my dietician on Wednesday and I really struggled over half term. But I’ve been doing well these last few days, I’ve eaten off of plates which is something that scares me, and I’ve really challenged my fear of having more than 2/3 foods at once. And tonight I’m having an Options Hot Chocolate !!!! 😁
I’ve been doubting myself recently, but yesterday I got two high 2:1s on essays I was honestly convinced I had got thirds on! I was so shocked but it’s made me realise I can achieve if i work hard, my efforts aren’t fruitless! 
As always my DMs/Asks are open if anyone needs anything ❤️ 

Friends and family who aren’t super educated about eating disorders, but still love me enough to make a strong effort to support me 

Soooo good😍✨

And Gimli also seems to be interested in my yummy food ^^ 

In social media there is a lot of competition around mental illness. i have seen all to many times people arguing over who is the most unwell.far to many times i see the whole;“current bmi = 13 - lowest bmi = 11″“inpatient x 9″“suicide attempts x 7″etc. where is the need? you are ill, you don’t have to be the sickest, you won’t get some sort of prize for having the lowest BMI or for being hospitalized the most.

I’m in love with these protein fluffs now (and don’t worry I also had something else for breakfast additionally)🙈

 

@madsrecovers 

This is a really difficult question, and one that I am definitely not qualified to answer, but here’s my attempt at giving advice anyway.First, it would be important to learn their general views about eds, and other mental illnesses. Do they think lowly of sufferers? Do they treat mentally ill people differently just because of their illness? Are they one of those people that think depression can be cured by yoga and ana by eating a ‘burger?Ensuring that you know the answers to most of these questions, will help you determine your course of action. If they seem hostile towards sufferers, it’s honestly best to try not to bother with them, and look for another person to help you with your situation. This is kind of similar to the advice given to people wanting to come out as lgbtq+, and I think you can find some great tips about finding out the person’s views in articles and guides written about that. Just apply it to mental illnesses.   (Some articles either about coming out, or getting  mental help: 1 2 3 4 5 6)Once you have determined that your secrets are safe with the person and that they won’t react overly negatively, it’s time to have the talk. Prepare yourself for it, and come up with answers to possible questions beforehand. Like “how do you know?”, “how long have you been struggling?”. Consider that they won’t know what words/questions are sensitive, they might ask you dreaded questions like “how are you not underweight/how can you be ill and so big?” and others like it (even if you are underweight, them asking about your weight is sure to make anyone with an ed uncomfortable). Don’t hold this to them, and try to remain calm, but tell them that the language they used is distressing to you. Before you start the conversation, you also have to ask yourself: what exactly do you want to get out this? Do you just want to tell your problems to someone, or is this a first step in getting professional help? How will them knowing impact your living situation? Do you want anything to change? Be clear about your intentions while confronting them. If you want treatment, tell them, and explain your reasons why. If you don’t want treatment, do the same. This is another point where doing research, and forming arguments beforehand is critical - don’t let yourself be swayed from what you have previously determined as best for you right now after talking to another person once, but be open to their advice and suggestions. Disagree respectfully if needed. Offer them links, or sites where they can do their own research about the topic as well, but reaffirm them that you are open to answer their questions. If the conversation becomes too much for you, be sure to tell them! If they care about you, they will probably let you leave this situation that is clearly making you uncomfortable and leaving them a list of links can help in this scenario as well, by letting them do something in the meantime, that will make them feel like they are helping you. 

Here are some more articles that might help you research this topic, and come up with some answers to common questions. 

(DSM-5 criteria for eds, statistics about eds, bulimia nervosa, underweight health risks and treatment,, ed treatment options,  national eating disorder association, a parental guide for ed,  )

I have found this amazing pre-written letter as well, that helps you formulate your thoughts, for when you don’t know what to say:

Dear _________,For the past (day/week/month/year/__________), I have been feeling (unlike myself/sad/angry/anxious/ moody/agitated/lonely/hopeless/fearful/overwhelmed/ distracted/confused/stressed/empty/restless/unable to function or get out of bed/__________).I have struggled with (changes in appetite/changes in weight/loss of interest in things I used to enjoy/ hearing things that were not there/seeing things that were not there/ feeling unsure if things are real or not real/ my brain playing tricks on me/ lack of energy/increased energy/ inability to concentrate/alcohol or drug use or abuse/self-harm/skipping meals/overeating/overwhelming focus on weight or appearance/feeling worthless/ uncontrollable  thoughts/guilt/paranoia/nightmares/ bullying/not sleeping enough/ sleeping too much/risky sexual behavior/overwhelming sadness/losing friends/unhealthy friendships/unexplained anger or rage/isolation/ feeling detached from my body/feeling out of control/ thoughts of self-harm/cutting/thoughts of suicide/plans of suicide/abuse/sexual assault/death of a loved one/__________).Telling you this makes me feel (nervous/anxious/hopeful/embarrassed/ empowered/pro-active/mature/self-conscious/guilty/__________), but I’m telling you this because (I’m worried about myself/it is impacting my schoolwork/it is impacting my friendships/I am afraid/I don’t want to feel like this/I don’t know what to do/I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this/I trust you/__________).I would like to (talk to a doctor or therapist/talk to a guidance counselor/talk to my teachers/talk about this later/create a plan to get better/talk about this more/find a support group/__________) and I need your help.Sincerely,(Your name__________)I hope this helped, and that using this guide, you can open a conversation about your problems with a trusted figure! Stay safe, and happy recovery! 

does anyone else with/recovering from an ED ever find themselves stopping and thinking how weird it is to not eat when they are hungry? (like, I caught myself today thinking I wanted a banana and looking at the clock to see if it was time to eat and wondering if I should change what I had planned to eat and have a banana instead of the apple I was going to have with my other food- it’s so weird to have a zillion rules and overthink all of this instead of just being like, “I am hungry, I want a banana” -> *eats a banana*” 

Don’t get involved with someone who:Belittles you Brings you downDoesn’t respect youPressures you into doing things Shows signs of being manipulative Doesn’t pay attention to what you say Laughs at the things you take interest in Doesn’t take your feelings into considerationTalks with you primarily when they want somethingYou deserve someone who treats you with compassion, love, and respect. Don’t settle for less.  

And you should know that:
You are loved
You are enough
You are beautiful in every sense of the word
You are cared for
You are strong
You are brave 
You are talented
You are wonderfully unique
You are more powerful than the voice in your head
You can do whatever you put your energy in to
You are naturally perfect and do not need to change yourself
You are intelligent
You are boundless
You are respected
You are credible
You are amiable
You are a credit to the world
You can do this
Don’t let anyone or anything tell you otherwise, you mean a lot to so many people, don’t give up this fight 





Showing my face, yeyy🙈 
this is my favorite dog of all time, he’s sadly not mine🙈 

A letter to those suffering from an ED:I know that what you are going through is tough. I know you don’t feel at home in your recovered body.⁣ Instead of focusing on how bad you feel, remember the perspectives that help you see your eating disorder will never again be able to help you. ⁣Your reward centre isn’t working as it should - that’s not your fault, but it doesn’t make eating bad, and you need to retrain your brain to recognise reward. Think about how you would feel if another sufferer successfully completed a meal. When you feel reward through something such as movement, remind yourself that that is what it should feel like when you accomplish something.⁣Restricting doesn’t make you a superhuman. It gives you an adrenaline rush that is very short lived, and overall you can get much more done if you live each day at 50%, than one day at 100% and four at 0% as a result. You are not invincible. ⁣You have value even when the things you do are not perfect. Being reliable 75% of the time is better than not being reliable at all. You don’t have to be perfect to have value. ⁣Recognising your own value is so important. Be kind to others, but never at the detriment to yourself. Do not set yourself on fire to keep others warm. You were not put on this earth to fix anyone but yourself.⁣Most importantly, you CAN get through this. I know it seems impossible, I know it feels like eating dinner every day will kill you, I know it seems like you will never love the skin you are in, but I promise you one day these things will not be the most important things in your life. The recovery train will take you to far greater places than your eating disorder could ever dream of.⁣⁣Keep fighting, because your future is so worth fighting for. 

Trigger WarningEating disorder: Well well well it seems as though you’re progressing in treatment fairly smoothlyMe: Yes indeed I might even be discharging soon if–Eating disorder: It’d be a shameMe: Oh shitEating disorder: If you were toMe: DON’T YOU DAREEating disorder: Have a hysterical screaming fit in your therapist’s office insisting that they’re just making you fat here and you’d rather step on Legos than eat like a normal personMe: GO FUCK YOURSELFEating disorder: Annnnddd you just said that out loud to your therapistMe: DAMNIT 

Doctor’s appointment this morning… not sure how this is going to goMy weight is not in a good place, it’s similar to when I went into the hospital even though I was only discharged two weeks ago. I really don’t want to have to do another medical admission but I’m still on the wait list for ED program so I’m not sure if I have any other option. But it obviously wasn’t helpful last time.Oh boy. I guess I just have to believe that I can handle whatever happens this summer.

ey, ya’ll once again, completely off topic from this blog but here’s my recovery Instagram if anyone is intrested.@miyoko_recovery on insta 

I know what I have to do, I know the reasons and benefits of doing it but its so so hard whilst my energy and motivation are way down here?I need to have a shower because I feel better and it calms me down and being clean is good. But getting my things together, getting undressed, turning the water on, drying my hair….eh.I have a week left to complete my college project and I enjoy it and want to do well and know what I’m doing. Having to put my pens and pencils and sketchbook and journal in the same place and sitting and thinking and writing and drawing…..too much.Please future Nicole commit to recovery so you can function? 

I am worth recovery even when I feel totally un-worth it 
So here’s the thing. I’m sad. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I am currently facing redundancy at work, have little money and I am extremely single and feel like I have nothing to actually recover for… 
But this girl is still not giving up. 
There are far worse places to be in, and even if an eating disorder tells me there is no point to recovery, then maybe my motivation can be to prove those thoughts wrong. 
I guess this is a bit of a sad post, but I wanted to put it out it out there as I admire so many of these amazing beautiful recovery queen’s who are aceing it and in these wonderful relationships with beautiful houses and interesting careers… But I wanted to remind myself that even though I don’t feel like I have those, and am lost in life at the moment… That doesn’t make me any less worthy of recovery. 
Hence eating this cheesecake without feeling motivation, but knowing I need to challenge myself. 
 

GUESS WHO JUST ATE A WHOLE SANDWICH IN A PUBLIC PLACE WITHOUT LEAVING ANY SCRAPS EVEN THOUGH EVERY FIBER OF HER BEING WAS DETERMINED TO RESTRICT? 
THIS BRAVE ASS BITCH!

Where’s my trophy and million dollar prize??

                memoirs from a relapse            


Good morning, loves ☀️
I started my day fully productive! ginger woke me up around 5:30 🙈 so I got up and took her for a walk and made myself some cereal and coffee and then hit the gym! 
I absolutely killed my arms today, did a bit of abs and then some HIIT cardio. 
I found myself at target afterwards (guilty pleasure, who knew 🤷🏻‍♀️) and picked myself up a new travel mug for my coffee and some cute reusable straws. I decided I deserved a little treat and also because I’ve been using the same travel mug since freshman year of college 😅 
I want to challenge you guys to waking up a half earlier than usual and starting your day with something productive; whether it’s hitting the gym, reading a book, going for a walk, let me know how you feel afterwards. 
I really enjoy getting up early and getting stuff done. I feel like it sets me up for a good day and is a mood booster 💪🏼 
 

Alright y'all, here we go again.
Once again, my living situation is unstable. And once again, I’m (hopefully) temporarily crashing with my family. It is a toxic and abusive situation. But that’s not my main concern right now.
My main concern is continuing my recovery diet and keeping my work phone turned on. I am in recovery from an eating disorder. Some days, I only eat protein bars and shakes. Those bars and shakes are often the only way I get nutrients, but they are not cheap.
My line of work isn’t exactly the safest, and I need my work phone in case of emergency. I’d rather not go into too much detail publicly, but if you’ll DM me, I can.
All in all, I need about $135 a month.
My PayPal is thewitchsatticdoor@gmail.com
I can’t give much in return right now, mainly because I don’t have supplies. What I can do are tarot readings, pendulum readings, automatic writing, sigils, and spell recipes.
I’ll be reblogging this post pretty often for a while, so if you want to blacklist it, blacklist “emergency fund” 

so like. weird recovery question herenormally I would post this on my recovery/body pos facebook group but that’s been a really triggering place for me lately.so my question is, have other people, instead of getting their hunger cues back, started to feel extremely sensitive, angry, and/or suicidal when your body is asking for more food? I don’t mean that in the sense of “I’m anxious about eating so now I have all of these Emotions™,” I mean that instead of feeling physically hungry you get emotional or suicidal instead.  

ice cream is the best thing in the world and i hope y’all allow yourselves to enjoy it all you want because you deserve it 💛🍦 

Shaming someone will not make them recover. Telling someone that they are ruining your life won’t make them recover. If you want to help someone recover from an eating disorder, be supportive. And if you don’t know how, ask them how you can best support them through their recovery  





Long time no post. I can’t actually remember what I last posted ? Oh well.
I’m Wednesday I did something terrifying. I went to Maidenhead alone to go to the EDU for an appointment. I have big anxiety about travelling alone so this was huge. I planned it meticulously so nothing could go wrong. Until I missed the train, had to get a taxi to the hospital, almost missed the bus back to the station, missed the stop, had to walk alone Maidenhead main roads getting cat called. Andddd my phone died. So yeah, was hard but I did it! 
The appointment was brief. I’m being discharged from the Berkshire ED Service for summer and I have an assessment with the Kent ED Service on the 11th June😬
Then I went out with Sam for dinner to YO!Sushi and it was amazing!! We planned it for a week so I was fully prepared and it was lovely. I had the mushroom ramen  🍜 also Sam bought me the elephant teddy I’ve wanted  and I’m so in love- with Sam and the elephant. Today was my last IR exam, so I only have one exam left!! 
Alsooo… tomorrow is my birthday! Sam and I are going to London and to Camden market. We’re eating out twice and I’m really scared but also so excited to go out and explore 🥳 does anyone know anything to do in Camden and/or Covent Garden?  

idk why this isn’t talked about more butAIR POPPED POPCORN i can literally make less then a 1/3 cup for myself a couple times a day and be fine!! its super low in calories, but you feel full cause you’re eating something. it’s good to munch on when your thinking about food, and you can stuff your face with no guilt !  

a small update1. probiotics have saved my life2. the urge to binge out of anxiety is so strong? never experienced that before 3. had chococlate for the first time in 1 year and have had it everyday this week 4. got my first A Level exam today D:::: never been so anxious in my life ahaha 

I matter. My friends and loved ones might eventually abandon me if I completely give into my ED… But that’s because they love me… Not my ED. They don’t want to be friends with an eating disorder, and I shouldn’t either.  

yummy 😊

Breakfast.. Feeling guilty now. But I’m gonna keep fighting :) 
 

when i dont eat; it eats me 

Today I got sad, eating disorder related sad, for the first time in a long time.
This morning I cried as my boyfriend told me that no, half a bagel with some smoked salmon and yoghurt was not a sufficient breakfast, especially as it was going to be brunch, that i should eat a whole one, with the yoghurt, because my body would need it.
Today I cried on the sofa after eating said brunch and he asked me why I was sad as he held me and I said I didn’t know. I really didn’t know, I had no reason to be sad.
This afternoon we watched a tv programme and it was nice and I felt okay but then he ended and asked if I was okay and I said I didn’t know. I cried again and this time he asked what was up and I said I wasn’t sure, that it’s just hard when I have to go home and see my family, that things are different there and it feels like a long time ago when I was ill and that I’m not ill anymore but it feels bad and things are hard. He hugged me for almost an hour as I cried and we talked and I felt better and then cried again. He told me he had me and he wasn’t letting go and to talk to him and just lie down and think.
It’s hard when things get hard, and you have to listen to the one person in the world that you never want to have to see you sad tell you that they worry about you because you don’t worry about yourself enough and someone has to. I’m sad that he has to tell me that it’s not okay to block everyone out and just escape the world by riding my bike instead of sitting and thinking and taking some time. I’m sorry that he has to go through watching me being a mess and that he never signed up for this but now I love him too much to let him go.
Today taught me a lot about myself and a lot about him too. I just really hope that things feel better for me soon and that nothing like this gets in the way of the future and all of the plans we’ve made.
Sorry for the ramble. And for the absence. I hope you’re all well. X 



Tea time😌💕 

Im starting to get angry at my eating disorder 

Eating is hard. Recovery is hard. I’m trying to force myself to eat an appropriate amount every day, but eating anything at all still feels like too much. I wish I could just snap my fingers and have my eating disorder be gone for good 

I feel like no one really cares.Not even my therapist. And she gets paid for it.

HI HERE IS ME RE-COMMITTING TO RECOVERY AFTER MY LAST RELAPSE!!! Wanted to share this successful day with you all, let’s get back up and fight to get our lives back! ♡ 





Yesterday’s snacks.. It was a lot but I told myself to relax and just let myself have some sweets ‘n stuff :)  



having the worst time, the people who work in this ER are literal clowns 

today i was telling my dad all the things he needed to do to take care of my hamster while i’ll be gone, and i said “don’t forget to take good care of my baby!”he responded with “but you don’t take care of my baby: you”please, recover. do it for your dad. your mom. your family, friends, significant other. your pets. never let your parents be this sad.

                — 
                I lost time, and I am gaining it back. 


Got some new snacks for the following work days😊🙈
 

I feel very lost and overwhelmed despite in reality having a lot of things which are quite stable.Over the past few weeks I’ve thought about the benefits of an admission and have suggested it to my team but the reality? Firstly its unlikely I would be offered a bed as my physical health is relatively OK and my BMI not extremely low, neither my CPN, ED nurse or dietitian even replied to the email, suggesting they don’t agree and my CPN who makes decisions regarding my care has ‘never had a patient who’s been on an EDU’ (she doesn’t know what she’s talking about when I ask her about it) and is generally against admissions due to her experience of patients on acute wards. Secondly there are only very short ‘rational bursts’ when I truly want support and want to change, I think even if they suggested an admission I would contradict myself and immediately turn it down to due to not feeling ill enough and the thought of being admitted would make me feel so incredibly guilty, selfish and demanding that I don’t think I would be able to go through with it.Thirdly if I was offered a bed and accepted it, I can’t imagine ever in a million years being able to cope with a meal plan and even half a kilo of weight gain let alone anything resembling weight restoration, I have never gained weight without self harm dangerously increasing and my eating disorder is how I cope now, no self harm and rare suicidal thoughts but constant behaviours and I do not see myself managing with having them taken away. At the moment I am lucky to have a college course with kind tutors, I can go in any day of the week for as long as I want if I need a distraction and they’re understanding if I’m late or miss a session. It hasn’t hit me yet that in a few weeks time, this will stop. Final project handed in, no more lessons, no more chats with my tutors, no more structured days. What am I going to do with my time when every hour that isn’t planned seems to stretch on forever?I haven’t been at work for a couple of weeks due to the way I pick up shifts - I can work as much or as little as I want and recently I’ve physically struggled to work. It feels irresponsible to be caring for vulnerable adults who are relying on me when I am incapable of looking after myself but without work I have no purpose, it is a huge distraction and a reason to try.My friends are incredible but they have their own lives, friends across the country, partners, family plans, jobs. I can’t rely on them to spend time with me or to be there when I need them because its not fair or realistic. My family situation is very complicated, at the moment its quite calm because I’ve given my mom basic details of my plan with the dietitian so she doesn’t ask as many questions but some family members are seriously ill, not getting on, triggering etc. I feel like very soon I’m going to be in a position where I have no structure, little support and not a clue of what to do with my health in the worst position its ever been. Oh no I made myself sad.

                This is what life tastes like.             



                — 
                except you can, you could say no to being the bridesmaid at the wedding because you can’t eat at the buffet and the thought of eating a slice of the cake sends shivers down your spine, you don’t have to go on the date to the fancy restaurant with the one you think you’ve been falling for for a whilte now because you don’t know how much oil the chef might use and ‘what if they want to order starters or dessert, too?’, you don’t have to try a bite (or a dozen) of the that you decided to bake and maybe you don’t think the spoon needs licking anyway, go home insead of heading out for drinks with the rest of your colleagues after work, watch from the end of the table as your family tuck in to their home made dinner. You can eat earlier, later, in the bathroom, or on the way home, in private, by your rules, with your say so. You don’t need to have that food, so you won’t. It’s okay, you feel fine, you didn’t want it anyway. You don’t need to do those things like everybody else, having ‘control’ is more important. So yes, you can live your life avoiding food and eating and drinking without meticulous planning for hours or days beforehand, but living your life doing just that, is pretty much all you’ll do.            


Seriously, though. If any of my people in recovery are thinking about relapsing today, just know that Donald Trump is already the most smug, arrogant person on the face of the planet. He doesn’t need another victory. YOU have control over your actions, no matter how scared you are, and using maladaptive coping mechanisms will not change anything that has happened. Fight. Be here so your voice can be heard. Do not throw away your chance to create change. I am always here to talk.  

Dear Ana,
Today i threw my dinner, i ate 831cals but i burned 106 so that’ quite good.
Are you proud of me now?
Here’s a little bodycheck

fear foods for days coz i gotta fuel my brain for A levels (my first exam is next tuesday D: )
also got some homemade baked beans and some veggies  

You are not what you eat
You are not the size of your jeans
Or the number on a scale
You do not need to compensate for having enjoyed yourself
Our bodies are wise and you can trust yours
Diets don’t work in the long run
The most predictable outcome of dieting is weight gain in the longer term
Food has no moral value
We are born attuned to our hunger and fullness signals. 
Our culture divorces us from that when we are encouraged to eat by numbers. 
You can get back that attunement by listening to your hunger signals, eating what you are hungry for, and you will soon be able to detect when you’ve had enough. If you deprive yourself your appetite will feel out of control. It isn’t. You have to earn your body’s trust. 
The amount you eat will be different to what others need or want to eat. That’s okay!
There are no bad foods
You do not need to shrink yourself, live apologetically, silence yourself. You deserve the space you take up whatever that looks like. 
You’re not a failure if you don’t love your body
Body acceptance is a long term project 
Sometimes the best you can do is tolerate yourself until you can begin to really feel at home in your skin. 
Challenging your judgements of other people’s bodies will serve to help you accept your own. 
Don’t beat yourself up for your prejudices - acknowledge them and ask where they come from, then you can challenge them .
If you find yourself policing someone else’s body or what they eat it says more about your own relationship to your body than it does about them. Do yourself and society a favour by daring to look at that. Ask yourself why it matters to you what another person may look like or how they may look after themselves. 
Your body is your property, you do not owe it to anyone else. You get to make the rules. 
It’s perfectly reasonable to set boundaries and to stick to them. You do not have to accommodate other people’s feelings when they are disrespecting you. 
All this said, acknowledge that you’re doing your best in a culture that wants to whittle you down, create insecurities in order to sell you stuff that will supposedly quell those insecurities, that thrives on your self-doubt, that supports whole industries who rely on your self hatred. 
There are ways to resist. There are little acts of resistances and refusals to participate in this hijacking of our bodies. 
Try not apologising for your appetite 
Try abstaining from these kinds of comments:
“Oh I’ve eaten x I shouldn’t eat y”
“I look so fat”
“Did you see what she was wearing?”
“I am greedy”
“I’m being good today”
“Are you eating again?”
“She’s so lucky she’s thin”
“I don’t deserve x”
“I hate myself”
You don’t have to be all happy-clappy and fall in love with yourself (though of course that would be wonderful) - a starting place is just to say “no, I’m not entertaining this shit”. It won’t work magic overnight, maybe it won’t be manageable a lot of the time, but you can answer back. You have the right of reply. Your first thought isn’t always the best one. Ask yourself: “will this way of looking at myself lead me closer to people and connections or does it place a barrier between me and the world?” I know I’ve wanted that barrier many times in my life and if you do too that’s okay. But acknowledge it. Because at least then you have a sense of what these self-perceptions are really about. Even if you don’t want to change it right now. 

right now you might not feel the best you’ve ever felt, you might  feel that things will never get better. but don’t give up. tomorrow you might see something wonderful. the thing you’ve been worrying about might be resolved. you might have a good day tomorrow, you may smile. in a few years time, the things that are making you feel like this will all be forgotten about 

I made the smoothie again, I am kind of shocked because I got really anxious, I planned my meals for the whole day to, and I was debating putting it down, but I did. I don’t know why, I feel guilty but… happy. I don’t know what to think right now. 

And she’s discharged from daycare…what an emotional day. Happy tears. Sad tears. All the tears. I’m going to miss the staff so much and seeing everyone but I know the time has come and I’ve got everything I could out of daycare. Onto the next era/phase. With new pink hair to mark the occasion. And a whole set of new problems to face. But I’ve got this.  

I came down with a cold recently and used it as a way to show myself that I don’t NEED to exercise, I haven’t done my normal workout for over 2 weeks, which seems like a strange achievement but when you are recovering that relationship with food and exercise, it was actually pretty big for me :) 

i feel like im planning my relapse 


                — 
                Confucius            


I checked the scale again, (I know I shouldn’t have), and I’ve gained a bit of weight which I know mostly has to be water weight but it still stresses me out extremely. My mind is telling me to not eat tomorrow or wait until later when I’m at work so I’ll only eat once, but I wont do that. I need to do better, and I cant let this ruin the progress I’ve been making. I use the thought that I need to be better for my boyfriend a lot, but I also just need to be better for myself. Itll be hard, but I’ll keep going 🖤 

no offense but if i don’t lose 100,000 pounds by the end of summer i am going to kill myself 



Something for the way home😊🙈 

my sister: are you hungry?me, downing my green tea with vinegar, sucking on a cigarette while wearing five layers of clothes to keep myself warm: no, thank you for asking though!! :) 

Sometimes my body image gets really distressing, and my brain tends toward relapse. But like, that bitch has fucked me up too many times so we’re done listening to her until she gets her shit together. My heart wants a milkshake so that’s what we’re going to do.  





What I ate today ♡
- breakfast: peanut butter porridge with banana, honey and berries 
- snack: an orange and butter and crackers 
- lunch: toast with avocado and chickpea scramble on top
- snack: corn cake with almond butter and banana 
- cinema snacks !! Crisps and a kinder bueno with captain marvel emotions!!!!
- late dinner: shepherd-less pie with beans and broccoli  

Hola. I’m here again.
Ieri sera ho guardato Avengers: The Age of Ultron. Sto cercando di recuperarmi tutta la saga, dato che con l’uscita di Endgame sono stata circondata da persone che parlavano di cose di cui so praticamente niente (certo, la stessa cosa accade adesso con Game of Thrones, ma diciamo che otto stagioni sono un po’ troppo lunghine da recuperare E sono ancora in fissa con il mio principio “prima leggerò i libri”) (il che vuol dire che la serie di GoT non la vedrò mai, visto come non sto procedendo nella lettura).
Per molti anni sono stata tagliata veramente fuori dalla vita, persino dalle cose banali come film in uscita. “Sono stata tagliata fuori dalla vita” aka “mi sono tagliata fuori dalla vita” aka “la mia malattia mi ha tagliata fuori dalla vita”. Ancora su molte cose sono come una bambina. Certo, ho vissuto realtà sulla mia pelle che poche persone possono “vantarsi” di aver toccato (per quanto uno invece dovrebbe ringraziare il cielo che non sia capitato a lui), e sì, non tornerei indietro.
Non ho intenzione di mentire su questo. Non cancellerei il mio dca dal mio passato, non tornerei indietro per schiaffeggiare la mia me di sei anni e passa fa per dirle “ma che cazzo fai?”. La mia vita è stata una merda, ma so che se non fosse subentrato il dca ci sarebbe stato qualcos’altro. Forse le droghe, visto il tipo di persone alle quali stavo avvicinandomi. Non parlo di droghe pesanti eh, ma comunque qualcosa che non mi avrebbe portata a situazioni molto migliori di quella attuale. Forse sarebbe finita prima, forse sarebbe finita in modo diverso, forse sarei stata solo in un centro di riabilitazione o forse mi sarei bruciata totalmente la testa.
La verità è che, quando si sta davvero male (qualunque il motivo sia), un modo per scappare si cerca sempre. E spesso questi modi sono autodistruttivi. Si spera che ci diano salvezza, che ci diano uno scopo, che ci rendano qualcuno… e per un po’ è vero. Ma cosa può portarti di buono un’etichetta come “drogata”, “autolesionista”, “anoressica”? E non intendo a livello sociale, di quello che pensano gli altri, ma intendo SU DI TE.

Confessing my ice cream addiction.. 😇
 

Dunkin’s coconut creme pie iced coffee with almond milk is the shit…. if you’ve never had it, go get some immediately! Also if you’re not, follow my foodie insta @ indyeatsss!!! 

I saw my home treatment nurse this morning to discuss they next steps. I have a few options:Stay in Reading and attend day patient over summer with my team Get transferred back to Kent for summer and see if they can arrange day patient (although there isn’t a solid ED service there yet so it’s unclear if there’s an NHS day patient unit)Get transferred to Kent, attend outpatient over summer, then start uni again tomorrow in October whilst attending the Maidenhead day patient.I’ve chosen the latter. I really do not want to spend my summer here. The transfer was put in today so hopefully I’ll hear back from the Kent services before I go home in June. If it goes to plan it will slightly suck because I’ll have to balance hospital and uni but I’m utterly determined to do well next year as it actually counts towards my degree. I imagine I’ll have an initial assessment with the Kent service (if the transfer is excepted) and they’ll give me more of an idea of what’s going on. I’m still slightly in the dark, nothing is certain yet but I know what I want to happen for the first time in a while. I’m seeing HTT and the dietician at the EDU on the 22nd May, but if there’s any progression before then they’ll be in touch. Also, has anyone experienced achy legs as a symptom? For a few weeks now I lie in bed and my legs really lightly cramp, it doesn’t hurt at all but it’s uncomfortable. You know when you sit with you legs tucked up for too long and they ache when you move them into another position? It kinda feels like that but when I’m stretched out. (Note: I don’t exercise at all apart from walking around but nothing strenuous at all)  

HI, MY NAME IS _______ AND I HAVE BULIMIA.I’m so damn tired of
 feeling ashamed of having bulimia rather than Anorexia, it’s such a 
stigmatized illness–I mean no body wants to talk about puking but hey, 
it’s something I have struggled with for years and years and I AM NOT 
ASHAMED ANYMORE. Reblog this to spread awareness that bulimia is just as
 serious as Anorexia and deserves more recognition and support!!! Add 
your own personal stories of bulimia recovery or struggle, their NEEDS 
to be more awareness and less shame and secrecy.  

I’m gonna win this fight 

🌺 You are worth recovery 🌺 



I ate way too little yesterday and I just couldn’t let my ED voice in my head win so I thought about it for like over an hour and then decided to just do it and buy myself really good ice cream. At first I thought I can not finish it after a few scoops and I put it back in the freezer but then after a few hours my stomach felt better and I could eat the whole pint. With the ice cream I had about  2300 calories in total then and I didn’t let Ana control my life that day :)  

I AM GOING TO RECOVERITS GOING TO BE LONG AND HARD BUT I WILL, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS EVER HAPPENS TO ME 

🦑Stupid Struggle🦑In my opinion, this struggle I face is one that I feel is quite vain and embarrassing😔-🦑- Idk how to know I’m more than my appearance😔 I feel like it’s the only thing I think about and that if I gain weight or stop wearing mascara that a guy won’t ever like me or people won’t respect me and Idk how to get rid of this mindset:(( -🦑- I know it’s not true but I still believe it and idk how to stop believing it. I’m terrified to let go of this way of thinking because my life is so boring that I have nothing else to think about-🦑- i want to move on from the imperfections on my face and how my body doesn’t look like the ideal -🦑- I want to live my life, eat the food I want, be friends with who I want. -🦑- and most importantly, I want to stop walking around thinking that my life goal is to look good for men. I think how I was raised has made me think that I’m a failure if a boy doesn’t like me and I’m not pretty enough for them -🦑- I don’t know why I felt “no okay” when guys liked other girls who weren’t me -🦑- I wish it didn’t affect me because I should be living my life to its fullest and not worrying about why guys don’t like me or why I’ve never had a boyfriend-🦑- if I’m having fun being myself, and my looks just aren’t appealing to them, then I shouldn’t care. -🦑- I shouldn’t care about what people think-🦑- but then I go on and care -🦑- girls give me a weird look when I say I’ve never dated someone before or that I don’t even talk to guys -🦑- I feel judged by them -🦑- but I guess I shouldn’t care about what they think and move on -🦑- and I’m trying to do that-🦑- but it’s easier said than done -🦑- but I really hope one day I can live freely and not care what others think and focus on me and the people who love me and accept me  



May 12 ‘19
-Just a body check from today! Last night i ate a shit ton of salty crackers and salt alwayyyss makes me retain water so i was pretty bloated today when i woke up BUT i drank hella green tea with ginger bc ginger always helps my bloating go down and i took a shot of ACV with some cayenne and I honestly cant believe how much my tummy flattened back out. In other news, ive been restricting again (abt 800 cals) so im losing again FINALLY, im hoping i can make my gw by summer. Im super hyped too bc I just noticed that my shoulder blades are starting to peek out! Im surprisingly happy today despite my binge last night. I hope you all are doing good today and are staying safe xoxo ♥️ (pics are me) 

Soooooo tired. And I have to be up for therapy at 7am. Then I’m working a Late 😭just no. No thank you. I need a break. This week has been so long and emotionally exhausting. BUT I did have pancakes with berries and maple syrup for lunch 🎉 which was a big challenge but so yum and good preparation for American food. Gotta keep pushing with this whole recovery thing because I am not about that half recovered life. Made a list of all my silly rules and restrictions and all my remaing fear foods and there is definitely still work to be done. Got stuck in a bit of a safe routine and felt trapped bc of fear of more weight gain given that I am well over BMI of 20. But I’d rather have more life. And yummy food. Rational Katie would choose that over a stupid number. So what body image sucks but I need to trust my body and my body is telling me it’s not at my set point yet. Have to keep going.  



smiling because of anxiety not happiness..

Got a nice box from Dörrwerk yesterday.
Loved their tomato chips and the apple/mango fruit snack so I wanted to try some different products too.
And I was very happy and suprised to recive a gift from Dörrwerk. One of their products I really thought about buying but I didn’t because I didn’t want to spent too much money again🙈 so this made me very happy :)  

 

I usually don’t ever allow myself to have a full snack all at once. For example if I bought myself such a Twix or any other chocolate bar I could only have a small bite every 5 or 10 minutes. Or if I was on my way to my boyfriend I would have one small piece of the snack every train stop.
Can anyone else relate?😅 

In nutrition appointment Dietitian: It’s very important that you take it easy and refrain from physical activityMe: Yes of course that makes absolute perfect sense I will heed your advice 100000%In unsupervised apartment that eveningEating disorder: You know what’d be super fun? Aggressive yoga 

does anyone else get emotional flashbacks of their worst time in EDs? I feel like that’s such a thing, and honestly the worst days/months of my anorexia are registered in my brain as a traumatic event and I will constantly go through all the memories and experience flashbacks and so much discomfort

‘Your life only gets better when you do. Work on yourself and the rest will follow’ 



Having some healthy snacks on my way to my boyfriend. These are like fruit rolls I used to do some time ago :)  

UpdateSo, a update on how things ate going, well yesterday and before that were okay, I was definitely struggling to get my calories in, had about 950 both days, and today I didn’t count. I think I am around 1700, I pushed myself really hard!Thinking about how well today went makes me smile, I have eaten a little candy(had a sugar crash), got a sugar headache(I don’t usually eat anything with +5g sugar) I even had chicken stir fry for dinner, my favourite! My weight is a little strange right now, I am pretty bloated and my body isn’t reacting well to my low calorie days, hopefully it’ll even out soon as I try to drink more smoothies and have apple sauce or pineapple.(I actually have a sensitivity to any citres fruits, including pineapple but whatever.) 


                — 
                my staff, when I expressed concerns about overidentifying with my patient, and the amount of counter transferrence I was experiencing and wondering what that said about my level of functionality, reassuring me that I was totally fine, without knowing that in 7 weeks I’m going to be sitting on the patient side of the table            


Big challenge today: eating out with my family after already eating breakfast and lunch. I usually don’t ever eat lunch and dinner.


Although I couldn’t finish it (because of the snacks I had before and because it was way too much) I am still proud of myself🐝✨
Other, way way bigger challenge was ordering something else than water, I haven’t had any real liquid calories for a long time and it scares me even more than some high calorie foods. 

 

Why yes fellow nutrition-consumers this menu does look quite delicious and not at all terrifying; what food items are you all considering ordering in a totally normal non-panicked food ordering way?  I personally am very eager for and not screaming inside about these large portions, and I am utterly unfazed by the caloric information written next to each entre nope that doesn’t make me want to run for the hills at all :) I am so excited for this wow 

Long time no post. Accidentally locked myself out of tumblr. Things are still feeling really hard. My generalised anxiety is through the roof and OCD is quite debilitating at the moment.  But in other news I now have my visa for camp America and I leave in under a month. I only have a few therapy sessions left until we break till September and then we will gradually transition to monthly sessions before likely discharge in December. My OCD therapy should start in September so hopefully all the timings will work out and I’ll be supported through my first term back at university, which is likely to be very stressful and a test of my recovery. I’m currently at a crossroads in my ED recovery. Urges to restrict have been very high in amongst all this uncertainty and anxiety and I’ve found myself slipping a little with food. Nothing drastic but I know I actively need to stay on track and start pushing my recovery forwards, as I feel trapped in this strange limbo where I am not relapsing but I don’t feel like I am making progress. America should help to break down my rules and restrictions and routines, which in itself is terrifying, but I know I need to start challenging things again and letting go of control, if I want this to be a full and lasting recovery. Otherwise, I’m starting to feel excited for camp and university and have begun studying/reading and planning my dissertation and oh my goodness missed it a lot! I get so much out of a few hours of learning and just occupying my very busy mind and I’m so passionate about psychology and am starting to feel hopeful for a future in clinical psychology/academia/research. Work is going ok but I am so ready to leave. But yes, that’s where I’m at. I will reply to my outstanding messages in the next few days. Sorry for disappearing off the radar slightly.  

So i saw another counselor today. It was super weird and hard. Mainly hard because she asked some specific questions that the other lady hadn’t brought up. I’m supposed to go back to her sometime soon, but i’m not sure if i’ll continue because she makes me slightly uncomfortable.

sometimes giving yourself a mental pep talk during meals is how we get through recovery.  “OK, BITCH. This is just a fucking bowl of cereal. Just cereal. This is tasty. This is great.” *repeat 10 times til i finally give 0 fucks*  



Today’s morning and night snack🍭🍬 

One of the most frustrating parts of anorexia/presumably any other eating disorder is the fact that, having once demonstrated prolonged dishonesty about your eating habits, people automatically assume other behaviours and won’t believe you when you try to assure them that it’s not the case. “Once a liar, always a liar.”I am the first to admit that I have often been (and often still am, when things are shit) dishonest about my intake. I am also dishonest by omission, I suppose, about my purging behaviours (I can scarcely believe it when I’ve been accused of so much else, but no one has ever actually asked me!) Those are my only ED behaviours. I don’t ‘binge’ by most people’s standard (what feels like a binge for me equates to an average, healthy intake for a day for most other individuals not suffering from EDs), I don’t take laxatives, I don’t take diet pills. My mum, however, has got it into her head that, in fact, I do take laxatives and diet pills, and because I have lied about restriction in the past, nothing I can say or do will convince her otherwise. It is like banging your head against a brick wall. Our relationship was tense before I moved back home, and it’s probably been worse since. We had a rare moment of serenity just now, sitting on the bench with cups of tea, in the sunlight, watching the chickens scrabble around looking for worms. Then out of the blue (it had NOTHING to do with previous conversation) she asked me what healthy, balanced food I wanted her to cook. She always starts off like that, pretending she’s being kind and considerate even though it’s just a way in to start pestering me about other things. It’s always a real ‘ah, here we go again…’ moment. I replied that it was very kind of her, I hadn’t decided on what I was going to eat in the next few days, but that I would cook my own meals once I’d worked it out. She then jumped in with “we need to talk about it, you’re damaging your body, I know you’re abusing laxatives”, to which I responded, calmly, but in a way that couldn’t literally make it any more clear, “I’m not having this conversation. If you carry on talking about this, I will walk away.”She went on “they will damage your heart, your kidneys, you’ll make yourself ill -” I walked away. I could’ve happily told her to fuck off at that point, but probably (definitely) that would’ve opened up a whole new can of worms. Best just to do what I’d warned her I’d do.I feel hurt that she doesn’t believe me, and angry that she chose to spoil the normal conversation and calm companionship that is so uncommon these days. She’s like a dog with a bone, and there are only so many times I can tell her the truth before I have to stop talking to her altogether, and just walk away instead. I hate not being believed! I hardly ever lied before my eating disorder, and for anything not related to food, even today I have to have a very good reason, and weigh up all the pros and cons, before I mislead someone. Lying just isn’t really a thing that I go in for.Not being taken at face value is quite a new and painful thing, and I’m so fucking done with the fact that on top of everything else, anorexia has taken away my relationship with my mum. It’s reduced it down to nothing more than a few terse back-and-forths about food, me trying to convince her that I don’t take laxatives, and her searching through my private belongings presumably to find evidence that I do. We hardly ever talk about anything else any more.This illness is so fucking insidious. 

Sent an email regarding ED treatment failures to someone who has contacts and had a reply from ‘Donald Franklin, PhD,Senior Economic Adviser,Department of Health and Social Care’ who advises on public health spending etc. which was quite exciting?‘

I have no magic solution, but I wanted to assure you that these issues are taken seriously. I personally have been working on economic policies  to ensure the funding of mental health services is adequate and also that funding can be used in the most effective way.  We will take your experience into account in this work.

‘Plus some other arguing with/agreeing with some points I made but I’m glad he took the time to reply. 

Eating disorder culture is accepting the food someone made for you out of the kindness of their heart and eating it with a forced smile and a thank you, only to think about how this is causing you to go over your calorie limit and that you’re probably going to gain weight from it.  

My friend offered that we make something fancy to match the amazing weather we are having. 
With all the meals out I’ve had recently and the ones coming up…my brain was instantly crying out nope! No thanks. Not for me. 
But I quickly managed to realise how much those were eating disordered thoughts… And agreed to her suggestion of a summer cooking afternoon together. 
I’m so glad I did because I got to try something pretty amazing. STRAWBERRY GAZPACHO. Yes, savoury strawberry soup. Im a rebel, call the police I don’t play by the rules. 
She also baked a gorgeous rye loaf to go with it. Yes she added way more butter to the bread and olive oil to the gazpacho than I was expecting…but it made it taste better. I even asked for extra slices. It made the experience more fun and I truly enjoyed this recipe! So summery and I would definitely make it again!

Breakfast was a chocolate protein fluff and a white curry omelette :)


For lunch I made a really good soup which filled me up quite a lot (and I challenged myself to have bread with it, even though it’s a fear food and I never add anything else to my lunch because of the cals) 🙈 


Before work I tried these chocolate coated banana chips. And I really loved them *-*


At work I had some snacks and I ate one more portion of my home made veggie soup :)

Decisamente non dovrei essere qui a scrivere, ma sulla via per andare a nanna. Domani e dopodomani saranno giornate parecchio stressanti, e dovrei almeno tentare di salvaguardarmi con una nottata di sonno.
…no eh?
Questo weekend avrò (finalmente) gli ultimi due giorni di riprese di un corto di uno studente di film making della mia Accademia. Dico “finalmente” perché avremmo dovuto finire quasi un mese fa, ma una serie di sfortunati eventi (cit.) ha portato a rimandare e rimandare. Questo per me, che se non ho tutto programmato nei minimi dettagli sclero, è stato davvero pesante da sopportare. Mi rendo conto che ho un’enorme rigidità verso l’imprevisto, e questo amplifica il motivo per cui ho definito le due prossime giornate “parecchio stressanti”.
Cosa è questo corto? Per chi non lo sapesse, generalmente nelle scuole di cinema agli studenti degli indirizzi di film making/video making viene chiesto di realizzare come prova di esame (o una delle prove) un cortometraggio da loro scritto. È così che lo scorso anno ho iniziato a muovere i primi passi nell’ambito della recitazione davanti alla telecamera: grazie a corti di studenti, prima di una scuola della mia città e poi dell’Accademia NEMO di Firenze (con la quale ho ri-collaborato anche quest’anno, dato che gli ero piaciuta e mi hanno richiamata). Insomma, questo studente della mia Accademia ha fatto un casting interno alla scuola, per scegliere fra tutti noi studenti di primo e secondo anno due attori per il suo corto. E sì, sono stata una di quei due, nonostante una volta uscita dal provino avessi la certezza matematica di aver fatto un’impressione pessima (vi dico solo che a metà provino, che sappiate vengono registrati, ho chiesto se mi potessi togliere l’apparecchio perché non riuscivo a parlare bene). Il che, diciamocelo, mi ha fatto un piacere immenso dato che io sono solo al primo anno (e comunque a prescindere, anche fossimo state solo due candidate, mi sarei sentita come avessi vinto l’Oscar).
Il problema? Che il mio dca mi rende tutto questo, potenzialmente fantastico, una sorta di incubo perverso. Perché? Risposta ovvia: a causa del fatto che dovrei mangiare in presenza degli altri.
(continua) Keep reading 



Very bored and uncomfortable and would very much like to be out enjoying the spring. Some dignity would also be nice :/ like my cool hospital pants?
All I can do right now is lie in bed and think of all the things I’ve messed up and panicking over how to fix them. 
I hope you all are doing better than I am, and if you’re not, hang in there.  





Today is a good day :) I’m in perfect mood and I’m on my way to meet my boyfriend now😊
Today’s breakfast was a crossaint ( I did it ^^) and a lot of tea. I also ate some chocolate and a little cake🙈 

Got this whole outfit for 40$ 😍
On a side note, looking at this picture makes me realize how much I need to recover… my shoulders look like a 7 year olds… Still showing most of the signs of starvation, the worst being my digestive issues. I’m bloated and uncomfortable most days of the week.. 
Going to start slow with a target of 2000 calories per day minimum, which I’ll try to hit for 7 days straight, before bumping my intake. I’m aiming for 80g of protein per day, which is about 0.8g/lb BW, but im leaving the rest of my calories completely loose. Ive been saying I’m going to gain weight and fully recover for 3 years now.. it’s time to hold myself accountable. I’ve been watching some YouTube food diary videos from other recovery warriors and I’m feeling inspired. I’ve hit 2000 for 3 days straight now, and if I can manage about 400 more today, it’ll be 4 days in a row 💪🏻.  



06/05/2019
I had the daily check in with G, told her that I’d pre made my lunch, I can’t believe how much it helped. I didn’t go down those automatic neural pathways. TW It was the first time in, probably years (aside from the handful of times when I came home from hospital) that I didn’t pick corners off of my sandwich. We discussed a little about self compassion, treating myself as I would a loved one, and that includes presenting and making my food as I would for someone else. I don’t make sandwiches for others any more, but sometimes I make Mum some toast and I don’t pick the corners off and make it all horrible. I won’t lie I did struggle with weighing the apple as usual. But I had an increased filling in my sandwich and ate all of the bread. I was worried about it, but I did it and well I’ve proved nothing ‘happens’. I can’t believe the number of behaviours I broke during this.
Ok, another iffy thing. Hunger. I’ve been starving since 2.30am last night. I woke up at about 1.30 and was tossing and turning, then my stomach started rumbling. I was going to try a different breakfast but was worried about fullness too much. I worry about ‘doing things differently’ as in eating more (like the amount I should have/a planned amount - not a response to the hunger) when I am hungry because my head says I’m ‘out of control’ and ‘binging as a response to the hunger’, but I did lunch. I was really full from lunch but not ‘satisfied’ and I think it’s because I’m stuck on the same foods? I had the same snack this afternoon and my stomach just feels empty and idk why. I’m not going to tell anyone at home as I get shouted at that I don’t respond, but I’m going to keep with my plans and I might challenge dessert/supper tonight. I’m also going to increase my portion at tea without using rituals to compensate. 
One thing G said the other day was that I need to go out of my comfort zone but in bigger ways, and making my way through the central column (the ‘foods/rules to introduce’ one) is a way to start it 🤔
My parents are back, and I asked them (obviously they’ve been back quite a while now😆) if they think I could manage something different at breakfast (I’ll not say what in case of triggers) and Dad said yes, or is there anything more calorific I could have? And I said well I was asking because I had fancied that food, and Mum got a bit angry and said it’s not what I fancy it’s getting calories in which is a bit annoying because I do force things in that I would rather have a lower thing to get calories in anyway too, and it takes a lot to consider having things I fancy. But equally, there are higher things too that I’ve been fancying. So I guess it’s that balance, but importantly, starting.
I’m really bored! So I might go on Sims or something now to pass some time. I can’t concentrate on my book as I’m feeling, ugh, the ‘h’ word, plus dad has the tv on, so I might either do that or maybe some collaging hmm.. 

so, standing in the shower this morning, I was looking down at the little tummy that’s grown in the last month or so as a result of Christmas lunches, cider, gingerbread, and honey macadamia ice cream, and I was doing my usual thing; hating my body and myself. But then I thought about something else. two months ago, I was standing in the shower, looking down at the flat stomach that had developed as a result of starving and working out in secret, and I was doing my usual thing; hating my body and myself. 
So, as I looked down at my little tummy this morning, I thought about the fact that, despite what I thought, I wouldn’t be happier if I had a flat stomach. I wasn’t any happier when I had a flat stomach. I wasn’t more loved or liked or appreciated when I had a flat stomach. I didn’t become a worse person when I let a little tummy grow.
If I had a flat stomach, I would instead be the same unhappy, unsatisfied, self-critical person that I was as I stood in my shower this morning, except with a flat stomach. I would be the same self-loathing, guilt-ridden person, minus the Christmas lunches, cider, gingerbread, and honey macadamia ice cream. I would be the same person, minus the entire days spent in bed reading and watching netflix. I would be the same person, only tireder. I would be the same person, only my hair would be falling out. I would be the same person, only I would be cold all the time. I would be the same person, except I would cry in the supermarket. I would be the same person, except I would be going to weekly therapy appointments and drinking litres of water before weigh-ins. I would be the same person, except I would be lying to the people that I love.
So, as I stood in the shower this morning, hating my body and myself, I realised that I should really be thanking that little tummy of mine because I’m so much happier than I ever was when my stomach was flat. 

I’m gonna make sure my daughter loves every inch of herself 

Reminder that recovering from Anorexia doesn’t make you fat. Healthy isn’t fat. 

For me eating carbs is too difficult rn, i will eat more fish, meat and eggs(and fruit and vegetables).It’s even better than not eating at all….right? 

Having lots of obsessive thoughts in the last 24 hours which has made me realise how little I have them anymore.Mood has been very low too. Low, hopeless, no energy, everything hurts, want to sleep but can’t.Handed essays in so just kind of drifting around for a few days before I need to start exam revision. Feel like a ghost if a ghost could be full of self-hatred, disgust, despair, questioning the point of life, realising I have nobody to even meet for coffee on the bank holiday weekend except some random guy from Tinder and just why is my life such an embaressement  





Made perfect zoodles today and also green asparagus😍 I know I’m having zoodles a lot but that’s kind of my favorite thing right now so why not?🙈
Also im trying to cook with sauces more and more, just to loose the fear of them. But only in baby steps. That’s why I’m starting of with low cal sauces, those make me feel save and I can get used to it again. If that makes any sense😅😅 



I am not my body. I am not my body. I am not my body. 
Looking forward to enjoying the spring weather this weekend 🌞  

Oooh, I actually had this situation. For me, I did a lot of redirecting the conversation because I was worried about seeming rude. After a bit tho, I just told her my triggers in context of like a tv show or something else, and she stopped saying or doing those things around me. So I did it subversively, but even if your friends are still very in their EDs, they likely want you to recover and will be careful. And you can (if you aren’t already) totally share with them the things you’re learning about your ED and coping skills! (I’m assuming they know you’re working towards recovery?) if you are comfortable doing so, of course. It may slowly start sinking in for them and then they may work towards recovery too! 





What I ate today ♡
I’m back ! feeling a little nervous, I really want this blog to be helpful and not harmful to anyone so I get anxiety about posting but I’m going to start again x
- breakfast: peanut butter porridge with flaxseeds, honey and berries 
- snack: a nectarine and raisins 
- lunch: toast with 3 scrambled eggs, spinach and butter 
- snack: apple pie with custard and ice cream!! I had family over and I also ate chocolate biscuits with my tea:)
- dinner: lentil and veggies with quinoa and sweet potato 
- snack: corn cake with almond butter, banana and maple syrup 
I’ve been really pushing myself these last few days with foods that scare me, I’ve been really sitting with a lot of discomfort and do feel the urge for control but at the same time, I feel freer than I have in a long time :)  

prom is this weekend and i lowkey dont fit into my dress and i lowkey wanna die and cry haha im gonna have to push thru it but rn im just Originally posted by werealljustwinginit 

I think I might have a serious tea addiction🍵
 

I am in a hotel in the middle of nowhere because I was delivering a workshop at a conference today. It’s just been one of those, “I can’t believe my life” kind of evenings.Yesterday I got the train after uni (3pm- for 15 years, I was unable to leave home after 2pm). Train journey was 4-ish hours. I just read the entire trip because I wanted to finish my book and I can’t do uni work on a train and I don’t have time to read much as deadlines approach (couldn’t concentrate to read the cover of a book, let alone for hours at once just a few years ago). Arrived in the city and heard music so went to follow it, feeling like a proper tourist. Watched some opera. Then headed to a restaurant where I was meeting a friend when his train arrived. Dinner was fine (tbh it was a “safe” place for me and one of the few places I go to eat but still, unthinkable a few years ago). Then got a taxi to my hotel and conked out. I usually like to be really settled where I am staying before I think about eating but last night it wasn’t possible and it was FINE. More than fine. I didn’t even realise until now that I skipped that step and it didn’t bother me.Today was wild. Hectic. Fun. Interesting. Food was the easy part to navigate. I had packed emergency snacks in case there was an issue with gluten free food and they came in handy at lunch. But the day was good and it’s just weird to think back to events I have been to before where I was so shy it made people uncomfortable, and then today, speaking out from the back of an auditorium (“no I don’t think I need microphone- can everyone hear?”) just feels normal.It’s not just food that’s easier. It’s everything else. Just being seen, being heard. Just BEING. Taking up space and taking part and I don’t know if I feel - yet - like I believe I deserve to do so in the same way others do, or if I have stopped letting that hold me back now that I know so many people feel, so much of the time, like they are the person in the room that shouldn’t be there. But I am not scared anymore of living. Occupying my body, rather than trying to fade into a shadow.Now I am back in my hotel and I just ordered Deliveroo for the first time in my life because I really am quite stranded. Then after dinner, I ate the few green heart-shaped M and Ms that were in the conference gift bag.// rambles

                you tell me you’re fine but I think differently             




Yesterday’s lunch was really hard to finish. I usually don’t eat pasta because everything about it scares me and to be honest I don’t even like it that much. I’d rather have some fresh veggies..
But my mom made pasta and there was nothing else there and I decided to try it. It was okay but not in my taste.
I ate about 3000 calories because I need to gain weight even though it is such a bad feeling..  

The key to my heart will forever be fresh seafood 🦞🐟🦑🦐 

Trigger Warning: Restricting & depressionMe: Is unbearably depressed for no reason, and has no appetite so doesn’t eat.Me: Isn’t receiving enough nutrition and hydration so becomes more depressed.Me: Is unbearably depressed and has no appetite so doesn’t eat.Repeat forever. 

I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I hate how I look. I feel and look gross. I feel nauseated looking at myself. I hate it. Everything feels dirty. Part of the reason I have struggled with anorexia is because I feel food makes me ‘dirty’, that fullness is a dirty/contamination feeling. I feel revolting inside. I want to strip everything out of my bedroom. Throw all my clothes away, paint my walls, get rid of everything. The only things to be held onto are the sentimentals, but everything relating to hospital and things I relate to anorexia I want gone. But it’s not going to wipe it away. That’s not going to make me recover. The reason I feel this way is because I am underweight, and I am in energy deficit. The only way out is to push through these sh*tty feelings and realise that a) they do not hurt me, b) they pass, c) getting through will help me get to the other side and will help.Just this feeling of wanting to be better is making me want to cry, is all. 

Okay soI have 2 months and 22 days to lose 10kg/22lbs or even more if possible. Now, this is very important, and literally crucial for my life. My birthday is on the 21st July, and also my sister is marrying in that exact same day. There will be so many relatives, and professional photographers, and also so many people with cameras, and since I’m the maid of honour, I’ll basically be everywhere where my sister is. I need to lose more than 10kg/22lbs so I can at least look decent. We will remember this day throughout our lives, and I don’t want to be the only fat girl. Please if you see this, don’t scroll down, and comment some tips, even if you’re new to this, comment something inspirational. Thank you 💖 

This is me from when I got my wisdom teeth out but this is also how I see myself mosT DAYS
 

Today I pushed myself to block out the fear in my head and increase my food from yesterday. I then found that my interest in creativity and hobbies also increased. COINCIDENCE? I think not. 



Tried out Protein Fluff from Pumperlgsund and it’s deliciooouuss😊😊😊 *unpaid and not sponsored advertisement* 



Recovery bloat.
Definitely one of the most difficult aspects of anorexia recovery. Currently feeling (and looking) like I’m 5 months pregnant, but I’m determined to keep feeding this body that has been with me through so much  

I want to recover because of all the things I want to do but can’t yet.Having a pizza with your friends. Getting popcorn at the cinema. Eating breakfast outside on a summer morning. Having a brunch. Having a picnic on your way for vacations.It all seems so nice but so scary. 

Oh boyOooh boy do I wanna drop all the weight I have gained. It’s not just a few pounds neither… were talking I’ve gotten thicker than a snicker….But what’s different is that this time I know it won’t help my self image 😶😶😶Xoxo, Lara  

 

Tx A feels like they’re pressuring me to commit right now. Like they want labs and rd records and EKG now. And already asked for ROIs and credit card info at the intake. But their intake was super person focused and less ed focused. I liked that but I’m not sure if I need more focus on me as a whole or just the ED right now. They also didn’t give me a tour or tell me anything about the programs. The intake also ran over an hour over time. PHP  there is 2 snacks and lunch. PHP and IOP are completely separate. PHP sees a therapist and a dietician weekly and program is 5 days a week. Its a local tx center with two or three total locations, all in my area. 


Tx B was much more organized. They gave me a tour and a schedule and told me all about the program. The intake was focused on ED and other mental health stuff for the most part. They’re also super laid back about me not wanting to admit until July 1. PHP is 2 meals and a snack. PHP and IOP are together–the difference is how long you stay. PHP sees psychiatrist, dietician, weekly and therapist twice a week. Program is 6 days a week. It’s a nationwide tx center with a location near me. 


So I’m super torn. Plusses and minuses things about both. The schedules are different. I know people who benefited from both. They both take my insurance. How the fuck do I pick? 

Hey y’all here’s a reason to recover. I went salsa dancing last night. It was amazing and I felt confident, comfortable in my body, and even elegant? Attractive? But just as I was getting into it my vision blacked out and my hearing went dull. Why? Because my metabolism is so low I physically can’t break down stored energy fast enough, or pump blood well enough, or absorb enough oxygen to fuel my body. I want to recover so I can dance.  

Trigger Warning!! 
This weekend was kinda shit.
On Thursday we drove for 5 hours and we needed to get some food, I hate fast food, I would never eat anything like this even without my ED.
But I had no choice.
I had a really bad panic attack afterwards in the car and just wanted that fatty food outside of me again.
On Friday we ate breakfast which wasn’t good either and than pasta.. Felt like shit. Then we saw a few good bands in the evening and went to sleep. 


Saturday was a high calorie breakfast which made me feel sick and made my stomach hurt really bad. 


I couldn’t breath the whole day and I passed out several times. Then in the evening they wanted to bring me to the hospital but my body finally let me throw up (sorry, tmi) and then I felt better. 
Now I’m on my way back home. Crying on the train because I just don’t want to live.. I’m sorry for all the negativity. There’s so much going on right now. My ED is not the worst thing. There is so much more. The only reason I want to stay alive is for my family. That’s really the only thing right now that keeps me going somehow. I just can’t find any joy in life for years now. Really. Even when I’m having a really good day and I laugh a lot I just can not imagine living any longer. I just can’t find the point in it for myself. 

This is my first ever ED recovery blog and I guess I should start it off by posting a recovery glow up photo 🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️ 



There’s a ~40 lb difference between these two photos. Gaining this weight gave my me life back. 
What makes me the saddest is that I received compliments, validation, and praise on the photo to the left regarding my extreme weight loss. Society can be exceedingly fucked up. 
I look at that photo today and I want to hold that girl and tell her that everything will be ok. I would tell her: You’re going to come close to death because of your illness — you’re going to go through pure hell — but you’re going to come out the other side. I promise. 
I would tell her that you are not your body. However, you live this life in your body and you must start taking care of it (and not in the screwed-up, harmful way that you’ve been taught). 
Beautiful girl, you will find other ways to cope with your trauma that aren’t starving; that aren’t abusing your body. Your body is your home: you don’t know that now but you will. It will take you years of depression and complex PTSD; reliving things you never wanted to go back to, but… you will be OK.

Dear Georgina, You are deeply intelligent, strong as fuck, and within you lives a celestial universe; a divine goddess. You do not have to live in an eating disorder. You don’t have to numb and be smaller and harshly blunt your enthralling, creative, divine femininity. Now you’ve cultivated the tools to fight like hell against your mental illness. Darling, please always take up infinite amounts of space. 
You did the best that you could. And when you knew better, you did better.  



It’s Mental Health Awareness Month and it’s one of those days where I need to feel motivated to continue my recovery process. It’s the first time I am posting pictures where the before and after is the opposite of what I would have posted two years ago.
One year between the two pictures but you can tell which one is happier, healthier, full of glow and love, and recovered from the deadly anorexia that consumed me and robbed me of life.
To anyone recovering, it is worth it. The thing I am most happy about since recovering is the ability to love tenderly, something I had forgotten was possible. I am so grateful I can love.

                Just Facts            


‘Frail’It’s a word I’ve just seen to describe someone my age with anorexia. I haven’t been described as that, but is that a word I want to be associated with? Frailty is something I associate with grandparents, heck, not my grandparents but great-grandparents. With people with bone conditions, elderly people who’ve lived wholesome lives and have their families around them to care for them.Not someone who is 24.Not someone who had never stepped in a doctors (aside from skin conditions) before anorexia.Strong, is what I’d like to be described as. Happy, is another. Carefree. Smiley. Full of life. Glowing. Bright. Courageous. Joyous. Fun. Headstrong.Those are words I would much rather be associated with.Not frail. Not weak. Not struggling. Not stagnant. Not ill. 

Restaurant - UpdateHey :)In frist place i’m gonna write in french, since it’s my mother tongue there is not that kind of distance that I feel when I write in english(i’m gonna translate below :) )Je n'aurais vraiment pas dû aller au restaurant. Il y a tellement de raisons pour lesquelles je n'aurais pas dû y aller. Je me déteste. Premièrement, consommer des produits d'origine animale me dérange de plus en plus, et presque tous les repas de la carte étaient à base de foie gras, entrecôte, pâté etc,, d'ailleurs, quel gâchis d'argent. Je ne ressens pas de plaisir en mangeant. Je mange soit par compulsion soit car mon corps à besoin de nutriments, Jamais par plaisir. De plus, plus je suis présente, plus je déçois mon entourage. C'est une réalité. Je ne dirais pas que je “m'amuse” à le faire mais je scrute la déception dans le regard des gens, quand je parle, ou quand justement je ne parle pas. D'ailleurs j'ai passé mon temps à essayer de ne pas me faire remarquer, être la plus invisible possible, essayer de manger aussi normalement que possible, bien que la nourriture m'écœurais et que la présence d'inconnus me tuméfiait. J'en ai marre. Depuis longtemps je me force à aller contre ce que je veux vraiment, plaidant le “bon sens”. Je mange à tous les repas avec ma famille, bien que la nourriture m'écœure et que je me sente mal après. Je me force à passer du temps avec les gens, bien que celà m'épuise un peu plus chaque fois. Je m'efforce à vouloir reprendre contact avec ma famille paternelle, bien qu'ils soient l'une des raisons principale de mon manque de confiance en moi à l'heure actuelle. J'en ai marre. Je vais tout envoyer balader.📝📝📝📝There are so many reasons why I shouldn’t have gone to the restaurant. Consuming animal products bother me more and more, and almost all the meals on the menu were based on meat.  Besides, what a waste of money.  I do not feel pleasure eating.  I eat either by compulsion or because my body needs nutrients, never for pleasure.  Moreover, the more I am present, the more I disappoint my entourage.  It’s a reality.  I would not say that I am “having fun” to do it but I scrutinize the disappointment in the eyes of people, when I speak, or when I do not speak.  Besides, I spent my time trying not to be noticed, to be as invisible as possible, to try to eat as normally as possible, even though i did not enjoyed the food and the presence of strangers was swelling me.  I’m fed up.  For a long time I forced myself to go against what I really want, pleading “common sense”.  I eat at all meals with my family, although the food nauseate me and I feel bad after.  I force myself to spend time with people, although it exhausts me a little more each time.  I try to get in touch with my paternal family, although they are one of the main reasons for my lack of self-confidence at the moment. I’m fed up.  I stop all that shit. 

I’ve lost weight again and a big part of me is so happy about it, but that’s the sick part of me. And I want to be healthy. So I will try to go back to a better weight.  

DUDE I don’t want to say that your parents are awful, but they sound absolutely AWFUL and totally un-supportive. I can totally see how telling them would be a bad idea. I highly suggest that you reach out to advisers at NEDA for help, because I’m by no means a medical professional. I do empathize with you though <3 I’m so sorry this is such a hard time for you. Hang in there.

                j.m.n            


I am so truly grateful for my grandparents. Today I went over and well, Gramps was asleep quite a lot and then went off and did some jobs, but when he was there he gave me such a good talking to. G (Grandma) talked to me almost the whole time about stuff and went through meals. She gave suggestions that were a bit, well, not what I’d do, but meant well. But we went though stuff and talked and talked and they’ve said for me to go over and take my food with me or they’d come to mine and gosh it just means so much. How everyone wants me well. She did say a few harsh truths, that do I want to get better? Am I prepared to do stuff I don’t want to do? If I don’t want to eat then am I prepared that this will be my life? And she said some things that I do not remember outrightly, but then they did scratch a little memory, about how when I first began, when I was about 15, she noticed I started eating messily. I was apparently famed for eating well, and all of a sudden bits of sandwich were all over the table and on the floor, and they didn’t realise what I was at the time. Then also a time when we went to one of the local restaurants for lunch and I caused such a fuss, but they didn’t really realise it again, because it wasn’t as well recognised back then. It touched me that she remembered those things, not touched in a soft sense, but it made me think about how long these things have gone on, and how it’s not a case of having a small box of couscous for lunch and doing sit ups in my room any more, it’s ridiculous, silly things that when I speak them out loud actually make me laugh at there ridiculousness.The truth? I’m terrified. The thing is, I’m terrified in both ways. I’m terrified of eating, calories, having variety in my diet, having more, sewing more on my plate, and then the bigger picture things like eating out, eating spontaneously…it causes so much fear. But on the flipside I am terrified of this being it. TW HARM/SUICIDE I told my grandma that if I was still like this in years and years time I would probably die and she said what through starving yourself and I said no through committing suicide ETW and that is probably what would happen. Mum has told me she worries about coming home and me having done it, and G said she worries to, it’s why she doesn’t like me home on my own when my parents are away, but I wouldn’t do anything like that as I know I’d hurt others more, and still there is a little hope. A tiny shred.The thing is, the less I think, the better I am. Once I make a decision to do something, I can do it. Like yesterday with the chocolate, and tonight I challenged having something I’ve had in the freezer for years and have hoarded away, and I did it and I don’t feel horrific for it. If I decide to do something, and then don’t think about it, I am better. It’s when the overanalysis and deciding and have that instead comes in that anorexia pipes up. It’s when the half arsing comes in. If I make a sandwich with rubbish portions, then I cut a little off, I think well it’s a shite portion so what will it matter if a bit comes off? Then it’s a bit more and a bit more and a bit more. But when I decide, I do it. If only I could apply it to the full recovery picture. My grandma said I’m so insightful, I know so much, yet I don’t do anything. If I could just decide and stick to it. I think I’m so scared, I’m so scared of things not working and of the whole thing that it makes me not make that decision to do it. Fear. I can do the odd little thing, make those odd few little decisions but I haven’t made that decision that right, I am going to recover, and have a few set things I will do to ensure I do it (because obviously it can’t all be spontaneous, there has to be some structure to it?) each time I try to, something comes in, and I don’t. I don’t follow through with the action.But I’m scared. I’m scared of missing more holidays, more birthdays, more Christmases, more meals out, more weekends away, more days, more opportunities…when the food isn’t there I can clearly see all of these things but the fear comes in around food and I don’t. But I have to. Because that fear is a different sort of fear. It’s a heartaching fear. Imagine getting to 30, not having had a proper job, not ever having held someone’s hand of the opposite sex, never donning running shoes and going for an early morning run, never getting in a swimming pool. Getting to 40, still being childless, never baking cookies with my kids, having osteoporosis, still living at home. Getting to 50, if I make it that far, still being partnerless, friendless, still a slave to the scales. Getting to 60 and being prematurely on my death bed, never having ridden a roller coaster again, never getting on a plane again, never seeing children grow up, Mum and dad dying and never seeing me healthy, never having a best friend, never kissing anyone, never having a single wakeful moment where my mind isn’t consumed with food and fear. Makes me want to cry to think about. Maybe I should think about that whenever anorexia pipes up. Anorexia is a, it’s a bully, a monster but also a dick, an idiot. I am ok. I am an ok person without it. My parents are the best I could wish for and more. My grandparents are amazing. The friends I have are wonderful. Most strangers are good people. The world is a better place than what anorexia ever will be. Maybe I should make a decision and stick to it, maybe I should start. 

things no one talks about when it comes to eds-you’re not going to feel happy at your goal weight. if anything you’ll feel worse. that goal weight number will only decrease and decrease. you will never be satisfied. -your anxiety levels skyrocket. you will feel a pain in your chest every single time meal times come up, every lunch break at school comes up, every time you walk into your kitchen, every time you see food on your dashboard. -you’ll start to notice changes in your body sure, but they’ll never, ever, ever be good enough. a year ago i dreamed about having a thigh gap. now i have one and it makes me want to cry every time i look at myself because its not small enough. you’ll never be happy with yourself while you have this disorder.-you unconsciously distance yourself from people. you don’t want to go see a movie with friends because there are too many snacks around. you don’t want to go to a family dinner because theres too much food. you don’t want to go to school because there’s a large lunch break. you don’t want to go out anymore, because food is everywhere.-your “safe” foods will no longer feel safe. that 50 calorie muesli bar suddenly feels like too much. that small 30 calorie coffee will make you feel guilty.-people close to you will notice. it feels like they don’t but they do. your mum notices that your jeans have become baggier. your dad notices that you don’t eat when he cooks. your siblings notice that you don’t have any energy to play with them anymore. your friends notice you don’t eat during lunch breaks or when you guys go out. your grandparents notice when you refuse a cupcake or cookie. people notice, and they worry. your eating disorder has one job. to make you unwell, and stay unwell. if you are even pondering the idea that you may have an eating problem or a body image issue, get help. talk to someone. you are sick enough. you deserve to get help. you deserve treatment. dont let “thinspo” and “proana” tumblr destroy you. 

one year after being released from the hospital for anorexia nervosa and acute food refusal i have… learned to love my bodydeveloped a healthy relationship with foodbegan to focus on my relationships with other peoplegotten my period had my heart rate improvehad SO MUCH energy. i’ve been able to exercise without passing outgotten way more compliments about my body. “you look so healthy !!”gotten much thicker and healthier hairno longer have dark circles under my eyes i’m not tired all the time anymorei’m so much strongerlife is so much better.please try to recover. it’s not fun. but i swear, it will be worth it. 

Today i am going to do something different.It’s not monumental bigger picture thinking, but I’m going to take myself to the shopping centre to get some things. I haven’t been in well over a month, and I can’t remember the last time I went on my own. I have a number of reasons why I always go with my parents, getting a lift so I don’t have to pay for train fare because it’s too much and I’m not worthy, and one other thing that has started cropping up (or has always been there but I can identify it?) is this needing to ‘prove to people’. It’s one reason why I restrict/struggle with meals/challenges in the day because I feel ‘no-one will believe me if I do it so what is the point?’. So this translates across to the shopping because I think I need to ‘show’ to people ‘oh look I’m strong/up to date enough to buy xyz for myself and I can walk around with bags of shopping and look like a normal person’. But, no. I am doing this for me. I’m going to take myself shopping because I have quite a lot of spare time sadly, and it gets me really anxious when I go at the weekend when it is busy, I am doing it because I really need some bits as I am literally living in the same pair of trousers atm (because even my harems/joggers make me feel depressed, so I’m wearing these cropped loose viscose summery patterned trousers) and I’ve had the same pjs for 4 years so I could probably do with some new ones too😬 and now I have identified this, it also needs to be applied across the board: eating proper meals when my parents are away this weekend, not just resorting to lemon fish and tiny portions of couscous, ensuring I eat all of my lunches, ensuring I make a proper sandwich, challenging different foods in the day and not gravitating towards the same Weetabix/tuna sandwich/apple/yogurt/nature valley bar combo every single day, not not allowing myself to rest in the day because nobody has seen me and they will think I’ve been on my feet and make me rest later. Because I am eating, I am doing this for me and my future, and because my brain will be the one that knows when I have done these things and will remember whether other people are there or not. I am doing this so in seven/eight months time when Christmas rolls around, I won’t be sat starving all day for a small portion of Christmas dinner and still eating the same breakfast and making myself go on a walk around the block, absolutely freezing. I am doing this so in a years time, five years time, five months time, I won’t be still sat doing the same. So I am not still looking at accounts from 5 years ago wishing I had done it then.So yes, today’s mission is have an early lunch, and get on the train to the shopping centre. I don’t think I will have a cup of tea out because the off peak train times finish before 4 so I’ll probably get the train around 3-3.30 and come home for snack. But it’s small steps and not really a disordered thing, it’s more monetary costing savings 🙈 



Are you more into coffee or tea?🌿
I personally drink a lot of tea and I love it. But sometimes I like to have coffee too. But I’ll usually put like 3 vanilla flavor drops from Got7 Nutrition inside my black coffee☕😍 



Feeling 🙄 

Throwback to May 13, 2014After my breakdown, I gain 30+ pounds (it was about 40+ in actuality) in a matter of weeks (LOTS of rolls and croissants); for the first time in my life I turned to the thing I hate most, food, for comfort. When my mom got sick, I promised her I would get healthy again; every hospital visit, I parked a few blocks away, I took the stairs (even if it was just 1 flight; also I HATE elevators, it triggers my claustrophobia), I power walked everywhere I needed to go and although she didn’t get to see it, 4 months after she died, I did reach my healthy weight goal.I might not be able to fit into this dress now and I’ve had a few anorexia relapses, but, I’ve been around my healthy weight for almost a year!!!!  


                — 
                Something I wish I had realised along time ago.            


i think a mistake many people make when they are recovering from an eating disorder is expecting themselves to recover 100% and never get the voices or bad thoughts or poor body image again. and let me tell you, that is not true. i consider myself mostly recovered from anorexia; however, every day i still get the voices in my head telling me not to eat, to throw it all away. looking at my body is a battle everyday. but i scream back at these awful thoughts. and while most days they are just little whispers, other days they are screaming so loudly that i give in. but i start over again every single day, and i really think that is recovery - the strength to realize that it is hard, but you must continue. 

Me: I’ve eaten for an entire month almost. I’m really proud Friend: *shows me weight app and how to track if I’m healthy* Ana Brain: *starts spiraling and finding new things to obsess about* Me: fuck fuck fuck fuck  

This month I’ve gained maybe 3-5 pounds and it feels noticeably uncomfortable. That sounds so irrational because I’m a bit underweight and that’s barely anything. But I feel physically different and it’s not a good feeling. I wish I didn’t care or couldn’t tell, yet here we are. What most stresses me out is that I don’t know why I am. If I knew why, it would be within my control which is unhealthy, but important to me. It could be that I’m just straight up eating more (am I?)- that’d be the most obvious explanation and as desired, within my control. I also had some health issues this year- thyroid cancer. Casual, I know. But I have this lingering fear that as my body readjusts to life post-cancer, I’ll put on weight. Entirely possible considering the surgery I had and the new normal my body has had to adapt to. I’m ashamed that I blame my body for what it has done to keep me alive. That’s a heavy thing to hold onto. Another fear is that the only thing keeping me thin is the antidepressant I’ve been on for 2-3 years. When I started Wellbutrin, I lost a decent amount of weight right away and it seemed to stay off. I’m afraid that going off it will cause me to gain weight. And a part of me wonders if I even need to be on it- another vicious cycle of wondering whether I’m “sick enough” or if everything I feel is situational. I honestly don’t know and that scares me. And amid this chaos in my mind (is that a dramatic way to put it?), I always have a safe thought to fall back on. I can just restrict more until I’m where I want to be. I don’t know what that mental cutoff will be, but I imagine I’m nearing it. Life could be so much more enjoyable without this self-absorbed fixation. I’d really like to know what it’s like. I just can’t figure out how to stop caring. 

On June 1st, I’ll be 6 months clean from bulimia. It really does get easier. Hang in there. 

Being in recovery from multiple addictions is a lot like one of those wack-a-mole games at the arcade. It feels like the second you’ve got one down, another one pops up. The thing though that I’ve failed to realize until now is that at some point you’ll be able to look down and notice that you don’t have to keep playing. I think those games are hacked. In a sense, the very reason those other moles are popping up is because you’ve got one of them under. I’ve got to stop holding onto one addiction and pretending I’m fine. I know my life will get a whole lot better when I surrender to this cyclical game. When I damn stop attempting to constantly keep up, and just let myself be free of all the addictions keeping me hostage. I need to stop trying to be in control, and in giving up that control—I’m actually winning. Sometimes Surrendering Actually Means You Win

Normal person, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                Ah yes indeed that was quite tasty.                    

Me, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                DID Y'ALL JUST SEE THAT AMAZING FEAT I JUST PULLED? I DESERVE A METAL. I AM A FUCKING WARRIOR GODDESS. I AM LITERALLY THE MOST BADASS PERSON WHO EVER LIVED.                    



Hunger It’s still a scary thing. So, I am on a new meal plan and all but tbh: I am still hungry. As in: I‘ve had a HUGE breakfast (more than my meal plan already), but barely two hours later I think about food again…this happens a lot and I want to blame me being bored and at home but even when I am out I notice it and somehow that relieves me a bit (because eating to cope with being bored is the most horrific thing to me). Still, when I lick sweet cream of my finger even though I had four frickin slices of bread with plenty of spread, egg and other stuff…it disgusts me. And I am terrified that I will just never stop. Other times I overestimate myself. I eat and then I am just extremely full all of a sudden and the guilt is striking again. It’s like; I ate more than I should have and now I will have to restrict because of it. But I don’t want to allow restriction in my life. I just wish, I could forget what I ate, right after I did it. If that makes sense. Anyway just rambling as today I struggled with my hunger and the ED voice kept telling me I am not even sick so why am I even eating that much and I am just looking for an excuse to eat. Having the 2-4 hours range between meals doesn’t help either. I try stretching it out to 4 hours all the time, but I just can’t. Does that make me weak? I don’t really know. All I know is that I eat the amount of 2 people every day. And I am scared. I don’t even have fear foods like others. Another argument that’s stuck in my head as to why I am not sick…at this point I just don’t know anymore and don’t feel good about the amounts that I eat. But if I stop then I am giving up on myself and my dreams. And I don‘t want that.Can you (if anyone should stumble across this) relate to this? 

admitted into inpatient yesterday and everyone is absolutely tiny. I don’t wish to be here. I want to go home. I want almond milk with my tea. Not having dairy isn’t a ‘behavior’. Everything is awful.  

When I’m feeling down, I have to remember that my eating disorder won’t make me feel better. In the end it always makes the situation worse. Self care is important. Self care is good. Your eating disorder is not. Recognise when it tries to take advantage of your mood, and put it in it’s place.

Eating in public + alone + grande drink + cookies = one yummy snack and a terrified eating disorder
 

Day Patient Okay, so this is really scary but today I met with my home treatment nurse following my dietician appointment at the EDU yesterday. We discussed where I’m at mentally, and how I am very stuck between an ‘all or nothing’ approach to recovery. I want to have a happy life but the decision to recover is so daunting that I want to make it when I feel fully ready and now I don’t feel that. I don’t want to half heartedly agree to something and then it fall through, as it’s done too many times in the last 4 years. I want to do it when I fully commit myself and do weekly challenges and continually build up self esteem etc. But I can’t and I’m running out of options to stay safe.But at the same time, I have to be honest. I can’t break out of my rigid eating structure, I struggle adding even 50 calories on to my meal plan. I am starting to isolate myself from going out because of the possibly of eating out, and I’m experiencing social anxiety over even texting people. I am terrified of eating off of plates for fucks sake and using a knife and fork at the same time. Although my the obs I’ve had done are okay, my body is struggling and I can feel that. As a result, I’ve been given 4 weeks to gain something, otherwise I’m being sent to day care. And to be fully honest, my team don’t really want me going home after uni without a rigid support plan in place anyway. It’s an option, because my body isn’t failing so they can’t force me into anything if I do manage to gain, but it’s highly unlikely. It also poses the issue that if I go home and then decide I want to go to the day unit, there’s a chance I won’t be medically stable enough to join a programme and will have to be admitted. So day patient is my only option either way, unless a miracle happens and someone back home is willing to take me on for 3 months and then transfer me back.It is scary but it hasn’t fully hit me yet. In some ways my choices were narrowing anyway, my family want me to go to hospital, and in some ways I feel like it could be positive. But at the same time I realise I have to join a meal plan and I genuinely don’t know how I’m going to cope with full meals again when I don’t feel ready. I want to comply and I will try my best but I’m so scared. I’m doing research into day patient units in Kent because otherwise I’ll have to spend summer by myself in Reading and it’s so stressful I want to cry. So yeah fun times. On the other hand I’ve gotten 2:1s in all my essays in spring term (apart from one) and my mood has been okay 👌  

Thank you so much! I have checked her out before, and although she is so clearly a kindhearted, beautiful human being, a couple of her things are a little too triggering for me personally! Like her “eating disorder story” with before pictures and her “my anorexia food rules” video or her calorie label videos and “what I eat in a day” stuff. I tend to kind of steer away from social media recovery things just because they tend to trigger me easily, despite being made with good intentions, and instead just have my support team and my treatment team. I’m so glad she has helped you though! I hope she continues to do so! and thank you again for this message! :)  

I really hate when foods advertise the calories on front for a few reasons
1- there are many factors to health more important than calories
2- there are many things more important to you than calories
3- the amount of calories cannot deem something good or bad 



Things I need to work on:
                                                making mistakes and dealing with the discomfort without totally spiraling out of control into self-hate, catastrophising, and self-destructive behaviors.                    



First day of day patient - exhausting, scary, overwhelming… The other patients are lovely but I am so scared that they hate me and that I’m making things difficult for them

me with an ED:
                                                i could just like delete this meal within the next 30 minutes and it'd be like it never happened.                    

me with ED but an hour later:

A Chat About Mental HealthSo if you didn’t know it is mental health awareness month and I happen to be diagnosed with a few of the most stigmatized illnesses as well as a few that typically aren’t stereotyped as belonging to people like me. So I want to.. talk about it. In hopes to break some stigma, break some stereotypes, and maybe even inspire someone to hold on? That’s asking a lot, so, let’s just see where this takes us.I was a sad anxious lil kid. I was praised for being so polite and mature and in reality I was being hit at home and I wasn’t shy, I was anxious. When I went to my grandma’s after school I would eat and eat until I could feel anything at all, anything other than the shame of having no friends. I will skip the triggering details but I eventually saw a psychologist who did horrible things to me, I was seven. So at the age of seven I was anxious, I was traumatized, and I had been engaging in disordered eating for about 3 years. I also had the perfect storm of genetics and a bad home life where my brain just went bad. Not bad like evil, more like an avocado you forgot about in the fridge. I was a good kid, a good thing. But the mush inside was not good. I had violent, angry outbursts. I started self harming when I was 9, banging my head into walls and touching radiators too long. At 10 the panic attacks started and to cope with them I would count anything and everything, obsessively. If I was interrupted I would panic even more. At 11 I graduated to other types of self harm, mixed with too many pills, and at 12 I went on my first diet, which involved a sticky note on my bedroom door saying “do not go get food”. Looking back I see my diagnoses plain as day, a neon sign above my childhood memories of “this is when you started!” and other times just a question mark of habits I don’t ever remember living without. I do not remember my teenage years. I remember bits and bobs, but not the way I remember my childhood, which is so cleanly divided by year. It is a blur of “why are you like this” and “maybe this time the treatment will work.”Things I do remember: the first time I threw a fit in the school cafeteria because my friend put her cheese into my salad (14), passing out and hitting my head on the stove on christmas morning (15), having a heart attack in 4th period english (16), long nights of texting my friend how scared I was the blood wouldn’t stop (17), crying as I walked across campus (18), the onset of kidney failure from dehydration (19), and lying to my loved ones (14-19).My teenage years were a blur of waiting rooms and bathrooms and my bathroom scale, the nutrition facts of my favorite foods and the taste of Kim K’s diet pills (grape, blegh). I saw a lot of people who didn’t do a lot to help. I got diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, Bulimia, EDNOS, and social anxiety. When I got to college I tried to commit suicide… four times. I got hospitalized and tried so hard to do better, to be better, to get better. It did not stick. I saw a psychiatrist on campus, we tried on a lot of diagnoses. I drank a lot of Ensure, I cried a lot. I screamed at her for daring to tell me what I did not want to hear. She diagnosed me with: Anorexia Nervosa (purging type), Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, ADHD, and the cherry on top: “Parker I’m afraid you’re on the path to becoming an alcoholic.” Life with these is not easy. For one, people are annoying as hell. Joking about having OCD when you mean, “organized.” Thinking that people with personality disorders are “abusive and scary.” Or, and this is maybe the worst one, thinking that only combat veterans get PTSD. Eye. Roll. Also the “you’re not thin enough to be anorexic” and “you don’t seem crazy.” But what is life actually like when I am, lowkey, crazy? It is listening to Taylor Swift while eating a meal I really do not want to eat. It is learning to plan for down the road, because I will be alive many years from now. It’s trying my very best to put kindness into the world despite the horrible things in my mind. I saw that psychiatrist last in June of 2018. Since then I went off my meds, attempted suicide twice, contemplated suicide a thousand times, went through another traumatizing event and got PTSD: The sequel, and also I relapsed with my eating disorder like, a billion times. I made a post on here in August about being 10 months into recovery. I relapsed the very next week. Then again. And again. This is when my kidneys almost failed, and I was told “you’re going to treatment” and my insurance said “no he isn’t” and I had to not die at home. and also it was Thanksgiving. Anyone else in recovery from an ED: you feel my pain on that one. I also celebrated a very happy christmas, I baked a lot of treats and I actually ate them!! I went vegan for the best reasons and I did not lose weight doing so. I cried in a very fancy restaurant but I ate my whole freakin meal and that became a favorite spot for us. I stopped telling people “I’m bipolar, not borderline” and admitted that I am, indeed, borderline. OCD is still a bitch, I need to be back on prozac. My room is a mess, just saying! But I think that my loved ones will die in a crash if I do not say “drive safe” and close the door 3 times and count the minutes until they get where they are going.In short: Life went on, and had very happy moments. Life dragged on, and left me feeling miserable. At this point in time I am 3 months into recovery from my eating disorder and I am struggling but I want to get better, truly, and that’s something. I am kind of suicidal lately, to be honest. I have angry outbursts and I cried in public the other day. But I’m about two months clean from self harm, and I told my boyfriend that I was feeling rough and needed extra support. I got told the other day that I look like I’ve lost weight and I tried so so hard to stay off the scale. I caved. I have lost a little weight. I can recognize that isn’t something to be happy about, even if I am a little bit happy. I am still struggling, that I can say. PTSD is here to stay, as is BPD. Manageable but not curable, that’s just my life. I am moving forward beyond the years of waiting rooms and hospital walls. I smile every day. I struggle, but I am miles away from where I was at 10, 15, 17. That’s my mental health story. It’s still in progress, but I hope it can show that some form of upward movement is possible. I am both a “it gets better” moment and in need of some “it gets better” inspiration. Thanks for reading if you did :) If you ever have questions about how I try to get better, or about my illnesses please send me an ask! I love talking about it, I needed someone to tell young me that I wasn’t ok and there were answers and help out there. 

It felt like I ate soooo much food yesterday, like 3000 calories, but now that I’m adding it up in my brain it was prolly like 1600-1800 max. My whole relationship with food is so fucked.Yesterday I was like “I don’t even have an ed” ha ha ha very funny

bath time!! this is rio, the 3 month old quaker parrot!
in other news, i’m on a sort of easy meal plan recommended by my psych, it actually doesnt promote weight gain because i asked her not to make me gain and she respected that, but my weight will be closely monitored and so will my eating so i probably can’t lose weight. my friends know now too. 
i think i might be ready to start eating normally again. i’m done with being afraid of food, i’m done with passing out, i’m done with being dizzy all the time, i’m done with being so cold it hurts, i’m done with lying to all my friends and family. it will be rough, but i’m going to try to get better.

Better late than never. I did it! I finally changed my snack and challenged having some of my Easter chocolate! I have been thinking about chocolate for ages, and the idea behind Easter chocolate is that at least some of it (or all) is eaten around Easter time! I did this on my own, no one around to ‘witness’ and ‘believe’.
Beforehand, I got my little recovery journal and wrote my fears down, and a few countering thoughts, and why I wanted to challenge it and it helped so much! I’m going to probably write in it how I feel later and if my fears came true too. It might be something to consider for future things/behaviour breaking too. I might try and do it for the leaving food behaviour but directly before the meal rather than just at random times when I feel like it 🤔 whenever I have grounded myself before a meal it has helped a lot, but it’s a) remembering, and b) orchestrating it because it’s a bit awkward with all the components of a meal, having my parents hovering around at tea and then being able to remember when I’m actually eating it and there are distractions around.
But steps! I ripped the plaster off rather than waiting another day for another ‘perfect’ time. I have put off various things for weeks and maybe I have started a ball rolling?! 

Sharing daily successesMe: My dietitian taught me how to cut an onion without cryingEveryone: Really? What’s the secret?Me: Oh you’re thinking I mean physical onion induced crying no no I mean like emotional distraught cryingEveryone: OhSilenceEveryone: …so the question is still applicable; what’s the secret 

Reminder Please don’t post before and after pics! These can be extremely triggering and there are better ways to raise awareness!

I allowed myself to have a bath! The anorexia part of me hasn’t allowed myself to have a bath in a long while. During the cold months I found solace in having a bath, it calmed me a lot and also warmed my cold bones. But I haven’t let myself for a long time, and gosh I feel ashamed admitting this, but because of the fact that it is time spent laying down that could be spent stood up in the shower 😔 it’s shameful how the lower level movement has gotten. 
But I finally let myself! I’ve been aching so much and Mum suggested me have one (and offered to run me one but I still had to have dessert so I ran myself one later) so I thought I would have one, especially as I have so many hoarded bath products too. Strangely, when I was there (and really once I had decided to have one) the OCD and anorexia thoughts were a lot more manageable. They were still there but I felt like my power was ‘above’ them and I was able to ignore them. I felt a lot ‘safer’, and idk, it’s so weird I don’t know how to explain it but it’s as though when I rest and ignore those thoughts (eg from breaking a behaviour or challenging a food etc) I feel so much more empowered and it makes it easier to go against? Even after a short time resting I feel more able to ignore them. It’s like if I am zooming around in the morning, I seem to struggle so much more with lunch, and vice versa. And then because I have done it all for so long, so many days, they have become engrained and associated and I associate lunch=negative behaviours, snacks=more manageable. It’s so strange and I wish, I wish I could go cold turkey. The thing that stops me is this feeling of ‘normalcy’. It is ‘normal’ to do these things. ‘Normal’ to not stop cleaning all day if you’re unemployed. ‘Normal’ to leave bits of food on the plate. ‘Normal’ to always be a bit under (although I can see that is ‘wrong’ because normal people don’t measure food so some days they’re over, some under, but then I worry that if I constantly am on the dot that I’ll be ‘more’ than a normal person which is such a sneaky form of reatriction?). I wish I would stop. It’s not the ‘could’ stop because of course there is always the choice, whether it is ‘normal’ or not. It’s whether I will or not, because of whatever reason
I have decided a few things anyway. I won’t write them here, I’m not sure I’m ready to share them yet, but I have made a decision, after it cropping up a few times in my mind today.
Anyway, this was so enjoyed. I laid and listened to the birds when I felt thoughts popping up (and just the birds in general as they make me so happy…I’m listening to them now!) and just relaxed as much as possible. A lovely way to end the first of the month (I also finished reading The Hobbit - and there weirdly was a sentence that said they arrived back on the first of May!) and I am going to get my supper correctly tonight, in order to tie with the decision I have made.
Oh, and Mum came home and had gotten me this cute little notebook from the gift shop at work! It was so sweet of her, as she doesn’t very often get me cute little things like this, she said it was only cheap but I really don’t care about monetary things, I love little gestures like this and she knows how I love bees and ‘don’t worry bee happy’ things. Little things that mean a lot 💛🐝 

you hear the phrase “you’re not your mental illness” so often and I only recently really realised what it means
like… sometimes you’ve been living with your illness so long that you decided it’s just a part of you and your personality and your identity, and it makes you scared to recover because you think that you’ll lose that particular sense of self that you’ve built up over time
so I’m just here to remind you that recovery is worth it because it’s not losing yourself, it’s finding the real you that isn’t buried beneath the self destructiveness and apathy and fatigue that your mental illness gave you and I’m on my way there and it’s honestly the best, and it’s possible for anyone so don’t give up 

I don’t write here much anymore, but I thought I’d post this: I am done. Today I completed my last outpatient dietician appointment. My last therapy appointment was last month’s. Today, almost 2 years after entering ERC, I’ve been discharged from outpatient treatment, discharged from everything. I am so freaking proud. There was a time I didn’t think this level of healing, of recovery would be possible. So I want you to know that it is. It is possible. I am so grateful to everyone who’s helped me on this journey, to everyone who stood by me, supported me. I am so thankful. And – I don’t think I’ve ever said this here – I am so glad to be alive. I’m not going anywhere. As many of you know, recovery is not linear. I may take backwards steps yet, and this blog will be here for me to look back to, to remind me of the steps I’ve taken, the hills and valleys. To remind me of the mountains I’ve climbed. I will leave this blog open. Please, feel free to message me any time – I’m always happy to talk. I’m not an expert, and I don’t have all the answers, and I can’t make it all better, but I can walk with you. You can do this. I can do this. We are strong. And we have lives to live. Onward, to the castle.  

Being back in recovery means being back in the kitchen!!
I’m hype for my work lunches this week - rice noodles with some premade baked sriracha tofu, bok choy, asparagus, and ginger lime red curry sauce. I’ve made this only once before and it is SO GOOD. And it’s an easy fit into my meal plan!
Although I’m just vegetarian (thanks, eating disorder for making my previous veganism disordered and taking it away from me) I still love to have vegan meals!! 

The truth is, you’ll never feel “sick enough”. Anorexia won’t let you. Don’t wait until you are ready to get help. Eating disorders are dangerous. Even if your BMI is “normal”. Even if you still have your period. Even if you think that you are in control. You deserve help. You deserve happiness. You deserve a life without ED. 

today i may have had two bagels in one day but there are worse thingsya know, like, living the rest of my life with an eating disorder 

I saw (another) new therapist yesterday.  Asically my last resort for eating disorder therapists in my town. It went wel. She was honest with me and said she doesn’t have too much background in treating eating disorders, but we agreed that if she feels things with my eating disorder are getting too out of control for that therapy setting, then she will have to refer me back to the Eating Disorder Institute. I agreed with that plan. However, I feel like I already need to be going to the EDI. I’ve relapsed. This weather makes me feel like I NEED to be outside on my bike enjoying the sunshine. I get carried away. I’m hoping my new therapist can help me with my anxiety and OCD and in turn that will help with my eating disorder. I hope. 

This ED makes me thank the heavens above that I’m good at maths…. 

I can’t believe I’m posting this but here is my body appreciation post. For the past four years I’ve struggled with an eating disorder as well as depression/anxiety and it’s been one of the hardest most painful things I’ve ever struggled with. For so long I hid it from everyone, for so long I told everyone I was ‘recovered’, for so long I thought I could live with it. You see, I wasn’t living at all–I was barely surviving. I’ve spent years wasting my time restricting, purging, and obsessing over food and I am so fucking done. For the past four months I’ve been in and out of Renfrew Residential and Partial treatment facility and it has honestly changed my life. For the first time in forever I am learning to accept my body the way it is. I am learning that what I say matters and that I can’t run away from the pain anymore; I need to embrace it. Please, if you are ever struggling with disordered eating message me or tell someone you trust. You deserve recovery. You deserve to live–just as I deserve to live.

There is this misconception with people who don’t experience eating disorders that once you’re weight restored you’re cured. THIS IS NOT THE CASE. How I wish it was. For me anyway, being weight restored has probably been one of the hardest things during my recovery. It’s like I have to be okay with this new, bigger body, and I feel like I have to fight with Ed even more. It’s like his voices get louder because I am weight restored, and he is telling me that I am too fat, and I need to loose weight to be accepted. Logically, the me part of my brain, knows that I don’t need to loose weight, I am still in the lower end of healthy weight range, and loosing weight would be detrimental to my health. But people around me don’t see why I should still be battling these thoughts. My mental health is still as bad as it always has been, just because I look physically healthy. Even then, looks can be deceiving. I am still suffering from all of these physical consequences from starving myself, even though I look physically healthy, I’m really not. The last two weeks have been particularly challenging for me. At uni we experimented with thickened fluids and modified textures, that a Speech Pathologist would give to a patient if they are having difficulty with their swallow. These are not pleasant at all. It was so hard sitting there listening to all the girls in my class saying they would rather be tubed than eat a modified diet. NO YOU DON’T. Being tubed sucks. I’m not saying don’t get tubed, getting tubed probably saved my life. But it was just so hard hearing these girls talk about it like it’s nothing I guess.I then had to have a conversation with my group of friends, who I am doing a group assignment with, because the topic has been really triggering for me. Quick over view, the topic is on coming to a decision on whether or not to tube a patient who doesn’t want to be tubed. This is incredibly triggering for me, so I had to talk to my group about it. I am incredibly lucky that I am in a group with my friends, but at the same time, they are my ‘uni friends’. I love them to bits, don’t get me wrong, but I have been trying to keep them separate from my anorexia recovery because I don’t want them looking at me differently. I always found it easier to eat with them at uni, because they didn’t know about my anorexia, so I didn’t feel like they were watching what I ate to make sure I was eating like everyone else in my life. They were incredibly supportive, which I am incredibly thankful for, but I feel like they have starting to make sure I am eating, which is making it harder for me to eat. I don’t know for sure that they are making sure I am eating, but there have been a couple of comments, nothing bad, around when I’m like, hmmm, I don’t think I’m going to have lunch, that make me pretty sure they are. I mean, I could just be making this up, and it could just be Ed telling me they are watching me, but I was a lot happier them not knowing.That’s all from me today. Please remember, not matter what the people around you are saying, just because you are weight restored, does not mean you are recovered. It is MORE than okay if you are struggling being weight restored, it is completely normal. Just try to hold on to the knowledge that no matter what these ignorant people think, you are not fully recovered, you are in recovery, but no matter what they think it is okay not to be there yet. If you are struggling, please don’t be afraid to reach out. No one should have to fight this alone. My ask is always open, and I am always up for a chat! 

I gotta say that eating out at a restaurant on a terrace in a pretty busy street, having a meal I’ve never actually had before, without having a panic attack during or after is something I really didn’t think I’d be able to do and yet here I am ☺️ 

repeat after me: What my body needs is different from what other people need. That doesn’t mean what I am eating is wrong. Comparing to others is pointless.  

Minor milestone; I bought cereal. Not the fitness ones with low sugar and low fat or whatever. No, I bought the real deal; cinnamon flakes coated in sugar👌🏻And I had some for my second(!) breakfast. They were far more filling than I remembered but just as good. I probably ate them 10 years ago the last time😂 

What is this Constant Craving? Is it for food? Or is it to fill a hole in my chest. An empty space. I forget.

I’m literally so bad at recovery… picking my own meals is so hard and I can’t allow myself to have anything above 400 calories for dinner. Anything above seems so greedy 

28/04/2019
Finally I had something with this meal, I had a lentil cottage pie but every time I’ve had it I haven’t had anything with it when it probably needs it. And I didn’t default to my usual safe broccoli and challenged having some peas! I know it’s not a huge portion but I started small as peas are quite a fear food for me (which is dumb because a few years ago they were the only veg I would eat!)
Myself and my parents (mainly Dad) talked and they have said that if I gain weight and get to a ‘certain point’ I can have a cat (or three🙈) and he’d buy me a car and a house and he’d do a bungee jump and all sorts if it would motivate me to get better, and idk I’ve had monetary motivations before but it hasn’t inspired me in the past, which I feel horribly ungrateful for being like that but I guess because I have my own money anyway? But the idea of having a cat, that really does inspire me, to potentially help an animal and also have another friend. It also really made me see how much my parents (especially Dad with regards these things) want me to get well, which is heartbreaking but makes me want to do it even more. Even though my parents and I argue, well, less so now, but we argue still, there is always ten thousand times more love than the love I feel around anorexia or the way anorexia makes me feel. I love them and if I can’t always do it for me, I will do it for them and potentially helping an animal and people in the future. 

Starting my Saturday with a snickerdoodle latte and a banana chocolate chip muffin 😋 (I did already have eggs and toast for breakfast but I’m still hungry 🤷🏼‍♀️) 
I woke up in a pretty grumpy mood and am doing the best I can to submerse myself in the things that make me happy; coffee, muffins, and a new book. I’m spending the day with my gf and we’re taking the doggies for a walk and getting Savannah (our pit bull) some birthday presents! I’m looking forward to a nice three day weekend for the holiday and practicing some self care. 
I’ve been so busy lately and I’m ready for some time to slow down 😌
 

Losing weight will not make me feel any better.Losing weight will not make me feel more loved, or honoured, or appreciated.Losing weight will not increase my efficiency or productivity.Losing weight will not give me a reason to be proud of myself.Losing weight will not help. Not at all.But…Losing weight will weaken my body and my mind.Losing weight will break me down into pieces again.Losing weight will hurt my family, my friends and myself.Losing weight will be coward, because you should not run away from your problems. You should face them. Losing weight is only a temporary “solution”, because you do not know how to help yourself. Try to figure it out, give your body what it needs and take care. Try to love yourself. Destroying yourself is not a solution.

I’m tired of my eating disorder, I’m tired from my eating disorder, but I’m especially tired of constantly having to think about how I’m handling my eating disorder. I’m tired of constantly seeking permission to recover, seeking assurance that I’m not eating too much, and having to go through panic attack after panic attack when I fail to find a justification for my hunger. I’m so fucking done with the anxiety and with having to think all the fucking time. I’m just going to eat what I want, when I want, as much as I want, and I do not give myself permission to worry about it. I don’t give myself permission to question whether I was ever really sick to begin with if it’s too easy, or whether it’s worth it to continue if it’s too hard. And I don’t give myself permission to spend another second wondering whether the way I’m living now is actually healthier purely because I’m depriving myself of the “”unhealthy”” foods I rely on to give me energy, purely because I’m so exhausted that I’m sleeping better. I’m done worrying about being “healthy” when anorexia is a whole lot more deadly than eating too many fucking carbs, and when I could gain 100 pounds and still be healthier than I would be if I let myself drop back into the underweight range. I don’t want to do this anymore so I won’t, that’s all.  

Eating Disorder Confession #2 I get very upset anytime I actually get my period cause it means I’ve put on enough weight for it to happen

                ambivalence of an eating disordered mind            


The goal is FULL recovery.Not settling for a lower weight that I need to control by worrying about food and exercise forever, not settling for a half-life, not settling for one hand gripped around coping modes that mean I never really get to be free.Not stopping here. *This* isn’t it. This is the hard bit - the “physically well but still working through all my sh*t” and it’s harder here because I can’t hide behind all the coping modes that kept me numb before. Now I just dip in and out of numbness, because it’s what I know and because I have yet to fix all the stuff I was trying to numb out in the first place. Either I am resorting to old coping modes and feeling bad about it because I am trying to break free from that stuff, or I am NOT doing that in which case I feel worse because I FEEL and have not yet learned how to deal. Or how to heal. Heh.This process, this journey, is not over. I am not finished yet. I am not stopping here. Not yet. Not here. I can’t stay here. I can’t LIVE here.The goal is a full life, a whole life, a whole me. “I didn’t come this far to only come this far,” as @faithhopeloveandtherapy once said.Keep going. No going back. It’s not over until it’s over.

Not to make a big deal or anything, but it’s my one year discharge anniversary today. 

I will not feel guilty for eating breakfast.I will not feel guilty for healing my body.I will not feel guilty for choosing life over death.I will not feel guilty for something I never had to apologize for in the first place. 

I had my CPA today. I’m now officially under adult MH services. I like my new care co and my new psychiatrist, they are both specialised in EUPD and it feels like they understand. We decided that it would be best for me to hold off starting the full DBT course until I am in a healthier place with the anorexia. For now I will go into treatment at the ED service - they have a day patient service which sounds really helpful - while the CMHT will support me with managing the EUPD. They just need to check whether my self harm risk will be alright with the ED service and how we’ll manage that. Then once the ED is less of a risk I’ll be in a better place to fully work in DBT. It’s all so overwhelming and I don’t know how I’ll face saying goodbye to my therapists, but at least my new team seem nice so far. Luckily the ED treatment shouldn’t take too long to start as I’ve already had the assessment and they’re putting me high up in the waiting list apparently. Things seem hopeful and I’m holding on to that.

I really want to share this video with you guys. Please listen to her interview about her anorexia. When I watched her talking about her struggles and thoughts I just feel like it was myself telling someone about how I feel.
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨ 

I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. it’s been a long battle and I went through a lot of shit to get here. but now my life has come together and blossomed. 
…
if you’re in the Hobart area, come to my gig tomorrow night at the Waratah Hotel at 7.40pm 

If you’re suicidal and still alive, I am so fucking proud of you.If you’re suffering from an eating disorder and still eating, I am so fucking proud of you. If you’re suffering from a mental illness and you’re fighting, I am so. Fucking. Proud of you. 

So many people have confided in me recently that they are having issues eating/self-loathing thoughts about their bodies and it BREAKS my heart. It truly does. It shatters me. 
You could say I’m overreacting, and that’s fine. Maybe I am. But as someone who has struggled with Anorexia Nervosa for over 4 years now, I can’t help but feel heartbroken at the thought of someone else thinking the same thoughts and feeling the same intense hatred for their bodies as I have/do. 
Please do not get me wrong- I’m not diagnosing everyone who has experienced disordered behaviors at some point as Anorexic- in fact, these battles we face against ourselves are inevitable throughout life. But it scares me, because I know that the recipe for my Anorexia only began as a dash of anxiety and a pinch of criticism towards my appearance. And I just hope and pray to whatever god may exist that our society finds better ways to teach and promote self-love and self-soothing techniques rather than shoving perfectionism down our throats whenever given the chance. 
Whether you’re struggling with Anorexia, experiencing self-loathing thoughts about your body, or consumed by the task of trying to lose weight, hear me out. Your happiness is not defined by a ridiculous number on a scale. Guess who cares about that number on the scale? No one. Guess who will fall in love with you if you lose those couple extra pounds? No one. Guess who will be happy if you neglect yourself and force your body to unhealthy limits? No one (especially not you). 
See that girl on the left? Does she look super cute and smokin’ and genuinely happy with her recent weight loss and like she has all her shit together to you? I didn’t think so. In fact, that girl has never been more disgusted with herself, regardless of the dropping number on the scale. See that girl on the right? Yeah, she’s still a freak. 😜 Kidding! (sort of?) But that girl on the right has gained a lot more than weight throughout her recovery process- she genuinely smiles and laughs, she hangs out with her friends, she goes out to dinner instead of turning down events centered around eating, she picked up her pieces and started going back to school after being forced to drop out, she just got accepted into an incredible nursing program (WOO, still stoked!), she eats Ben & Jerry’s icecream, she goes running and doesn’t feel like she’s going to faint at any moment, she fell in love with a compassionate and kindhearted man (oh la la guys, am I right?!?) and there’s so much more. 
It would be a (huge big fat dumb stupid) lie if I told you I still don’t struggle with Anorexia. Of course I do. Every single day is a battle, some days my head roars with insults and hatred. But the days where I feel alive, free, and in control of my life makes the battle worthwhile. 
Love yourself. We are built for so much more than trying to achieve a certain weight. We can accomplish anything we set our minds to in our lifetime, so why waste that incredible opportunity trying to achieve an arbitrary number? 

When ppl say that the carbs and sugars in fruit are bad for u 😒😒😒😒😒 

thanks for the bum, recovery 😍 

Mental health is health. Plain and simple as that. 

Dear MeWhen you get this letter I hope you are
still in your recovery. Remember how nice it is to be able to climb up stairs
and not feel weak, to lift groceries without help and to be able to dance with
your sisters in the kitchen without worrying you are going to collapse. An
eating disorder isn’t worth it; it makes you unhappy, alone, scared and
helpless. It takes away all the good in your life, your job, your family, friends
and any relationship you might have. It ages you; it turns you into a fragile
empty shell of a person. Eat the god dam food. It wont kill you, but
an eating disorder will. Stop making excuses, compromising or lying to
yourself. Eat the god dam food and remember that if it feels bad it must be the
right thing to do. EAT, eat it all, eat without rules, eat without restriction,
eat without minimizing, eat without fear, eat without lying, eat without
excuses, eat without hiding and eat without an eating disorder.Please, please, please stick to your meal
plan. Trust the medical team looking after you. They aren’t going to make you
fat, lie to you or make you do anything you are not capable of. Follow the meal
plan like it was medicine, don’t decide to manipulate it by missing off a bit
here and there. Be honest with your struggles, say when you are slipping up,
afraid, tired, angry or hurt. I know you may not like your thighs,
perhaps you never will, but be thankful for what they do do for you. You could
never run, do a yoga class, go beach combing or dance in the kitchen with your
sisters without them. Those poor thighs never satisfied you at any weight so
don’t believe the manipulative voice inside which tells you that a few less kgs
will make you like them. All a few less kg will do is make you unhappy and end
you back in treatment.Don’t you dare ever put your eating
disorder before your relationships with people. Don’t value your rules and rigidity
over a life of fun, connection and freedom. Pick recovery at every meal, every
snack and at every minute of every hour because that’s what recovery is, it’s a
million choices every day. It’s the choice to eat all the cereal instead of
putting some back, it’s the choice to have the full 2 tablespoons of almonds
instead of one, it’s the choice to go out to dinner with friends instead of eating
a wrap at home. But its also the choice to be a doctor, to be in relationships,
to have friends and to enjoy life. So please me, I pray that you make that
decision every dayMet yourself where you are at. Don’t you
dare feel ashamed of who you are or where you have come from. Your journey of
recovery is not a detour to feel humiliated by, but part of your life which has
made you who you are today. Embrace it and learn from it. Ask for help when you are struggling, don’t
let the eating disorder be your only solution, seek out your sisters, your
friends. Be vulnerable, allow them to see you as you truly are, there is no
disgrace to be felt from asking for help. Don’t ask your eating disorder for
help, it cant and wont help you. It lies, it steals and it robs you of the life
you are meant to have. Your eating disorder dosn’t want you to be a doctor,
dosn’t want you to enjoy life, all it wants is total and utter control.Be more afraid of not living then of
gaining weight and eating. Be more afraid of ending up alone with poor health
or even worse death then of food. Food is not something to fear. Weight isn’t
something, which is going to make you out of control, disgusting or unlovable,
but an eating disorder will. Please, please, please pick recovery, stop living
in fear. Fear is something the eating disorder has constructed to keep you
suffering under its control. Fear is living with an eating disorder. Be brave
and overcome it, take the first bite and the last and remember with every bite
you get stronger and the eating disorder weaker.Remember your values and your aspirations.
You dream of being a doctor, running along the beach, dancing with your
sisters, getting married, having children, traveling and being loved. You can
not have these if you have an eating disorder. Look at what it has robbed from
you so far, all those wasted years spent hiding form the world in pain and
isolation.I pray that you pick recovery, even when it
seems impossible, Pick life, pick being a doctor, pick being loved, pick
walking up stairs without feeling weak, pick travel, pick laughter, pick
family, pick friends, pick running on the beach, pick the life you deserve.
Don’t pick your eating disorderLove Me

Your happiness is more important than “getting that summer bod” 

I was tagged by @maggietries and @rhetoricallyashley to post 6 selfies from 2016! So here’s me blessing your dashboard with my face, your welcome :)) I now tag @adventuress-alex, @mariana-lifts, @embracingwild, @life-on-the-run, @keepin-thesunlight, @oatsnjen, and @rachaeldee! 

My life is big. I don’t know how else to explain it. Right now, my biggest problems are how scary it is to be falling in love, and the stress of applying to Ph.D. programs, and healing my leg so I can run marathons. My biggest problems are not what I think about my body or about whether I can bring myself to eat all three meals and snacks today. And don’t get me wrong, it’s terrifying. There are moments every day where I miss the comfort of a hospital bed and everyone being worried about the sound of my heart slowing to a stop. But please, let me tell you, how beautiful this fear is. Because I can sit here at my desk and see the journal where, exactly a year ago, I wrote a note that I thought would be my last. I can see it, and I cannot stop smiling because I know that there is no way that I will ever be in that place again.Please don’t be afraid of being big. Please embrace every inch of wild that you have. I promise you, the fear will be beautiful one day.

i cannot tell you to fix yourself or to stop whatever kind of self-destruction you’re doing, that would make me a hypocrite and if i can’t practice what i preach then that’s just not fair, but please don’t push yourself too far.  if you’re getting really light headed from malnutrition, at least eat a couple of snacks, something that can sustain you.  it’s not fair to let your body completely break down just in order to fit what you feel is the beauty standard, and i wish the pressure to lose weight was never reinstated in people, it fuckimg sucks.  im saying this because somebody dm’d me and told me to delete this account because it “glorifies mental illness and eating disorders” and it absolutely does not.  i do not try to make eating disorders seem cute or whatever the fuck, they’re painful, physically and mentally.  sometimes i can’t move because my stomach hurts so much from binging or from laxatives or from gastritis because i have been so destructive to my body, nothing about that is pretty.  i’d say that 80% of people with accounts like mine have them because it’s a release that they can’t have irl, it’s hard to talk about eating disorders with people who don’t understand, and on this website we can all understand each other.  but i understand that some things i post can be triggering and if you see something of mine that makes your eating disorder worse, please block me, i wont be offended.  i love all of you and hope that you’re able to be healthy and happy.  i know you can do it.

It doesn’t feel like a victory to go out for a spontaneous ice cream anymore.  There’s no fanfare.  I don’t want a high five.
It feels quiet, peaceful, calm, and normal.
Average, uneventful, free.
My mind is at ease and my body feels still.
I don’t even think to notice.
I just am.
(Pretty damn amazing) 

Having an eating disorder is one of the worst things I have experienced in my life. It is not ‘cool’, it is not something you want. It ruins your life. It makes you obsessed about calories, food, exercise and numbers. You no longer see food as food, but numbers. You basically are not living, just existing. I know how much the eating disorder has taken away from me, but I can’t seem to let go of it, it is still too strong and loud. It doesn’t want me to recover and it is controlling me. I think I need to let someone else control my food and weight and that is the only way I can get out of this illness. I want my life back. The eating disorder will never be happy even if you are at your lowest weight, it wants you to die and I am starting to realise that now. In order for me to recover, I must gain weight and take back control from the eating disorder.

Please reblog this if you are recovering from an eating disorder (and actually eating a good amount, actually aiming for a healthy weight etc) I need to follow positive recovery blogs 💖 

Dragonfruit and chia seed oatmeal 😋 Of course you can barely see it under all the toppings (which is how oatmeal should always be eaten). 
Summer started and I’ve been spending the first week at my parents house, it’s been soooo nice to finally wind down and relax. I’ve been able to read for fun instead of for classes again, and started Wind, Sand, and Stars by Saint-Exupéry, and it’s amazing so far ✨

I personally don’t think veganism is conductive to recovery. I love animals and I’m very passionate about the environment, but I strongly believe that veganism often becomes a means of restriction.Thoughts? 

So I bought myself a pair of shorts. This is something that two years ago I wouldn’t have even dreamt of doing. Now I’m walking around town in them. You can see my legs, the lightening marks on my thighs, my 30cm surgery scar, the cellulite. My waist is defined by the cut of the shorts. My arms are on display, that wobble when I walk.
I finally love my body- not all the time, but little glimpses of self love, and that is what keeps me on this journey of recovery. 

My friend sent me the sweetest postcard for our new apartment today 💙 

You deserve to eat. Nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. (Please do not delete caption) 

‘Don’t eat too much, don’t eat too little, don’t smoke, don’t drink, don’t do this don’t do that, do more of this but not too much but not too little’ 


How about you just do whatever the fuck you want because in the end you could be eat the perfect diet, never touch a cigarette or a glass of alcohol and exercise everyday and still get hit by a bus tomorrow so just live how ever the hell you want to. 

body study in pretty light. how is it that I am now more loving and nurturing towards my body than I have ever been, yet a year and a half ago I weighed 10+kgs less and I thought I was fat and could never love or accept myself. it would have been absurd to me when I was anorexic that I could ever love my body (even a tiny bit!) being in the middle of the healthy weight range like I am now. anorexia is a really strange illness. I can’t quite grasp how it can trick you so easily, even though it tricked me for 5 years. don’t be fooled.

                Why should I recover?            


Y’all I need help!!
This is what I’m wearing to my upcoming school dance
The wig looks more purple in real life but the colours are fairly similar. However the theme is “masquerade”. I want to make a mask like this:
But I don’t want that to be pink too. So I need y’all to vote for me. Do I make the mask with pastel blue and cream flowers and just a couple of dark blue ones. Or do I make it just white and cream? Helpppppp 

telling my truth is the bravest and most rewarding thing I have ever done. silence was filled with secrets and sadness. speaking was filled with light and purpose.their shame and disappointment does not have to become my own. I am allowed to have a voice. I am allowed to use it. I am allowed to be me.  

Growing up I was always told to hide the things that make me different.  It was never acceptable to show any form of negative emotion, or to speak about the things that were bothering me. Mental illness was always a taboo subject and never accepted. It wasn’t until recently that I learned that this was incredibly unhealthy, and that I shouldn’t be afraid to speak about my recover process. 

While those around you may seem happy and healthy, you would be surprised at how many people are suffering in silence.

It is estimated that 450 million people in the world currently are suffering from at least one psychiatric disorder. This includes your neighbors, family members, friends, teachers, and anyone else that you may meet.  It doesn’t matter where you come from, your gender, your sexuality, your race, etcetera, mental illness doesn’t discriminate. It has the ability to impact anyone, and it isn’t fair for those who are struggling to do it alone. Whether you prefer to talk with someone you trust or a professional,I highly suggest that you reach out. Mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of and don’t let someone who is ignorant or doesn’t understand convince you otherwise. Speak up about mental health and do not hide who you are.

I had a conversation with my nutritionist last week about the idea of “sick enough” and how I felt that I was letting go of the need to feel like I had been “sick enough.”  I told her that I hadn’t been sick enough to satisfy my eating disorder and that it was okay because I no longer felt as though satisfying my eating disorder was my objective.She said, “You’re right.  You’re not sick enough.”  I was momentarily stunned.  “You’re not sick enough for this to be your whole story.  You were only sick enough for it to be one chapter and a lot of that was due to your choices and hard work.  You are not sick enough for this to be the ending.”  And I actually feel at peace with that. 

i’m realizing that my whole life was spent counting calories, working out, trying to be a perfect weight when i could of been finishing college & having a social life. this disorder will take so much from you. the more I realize how many things i’m missing out on the more I want to recover and beat this. i know i will eventually see life on the other side of my ED no matter how long my journey takes me

I am moving halfway across the country in August to start grad school in a city where literally no one will know that I am in recovery from an eating disorder.  Moving could be a fantasy playground (/hellscape) of restriction, but instead I called and did an intake with a treatment center there to get an outpatient team set up with appointments before I even arrive.Getting shit done. 


                — 
                I read this somewhere recently and it got me thinking. If ‘skinny’ wasn’t part of the equation, would people still preach it and pine for it? I just wanted to add that along with the ‘perfect’ body - you get more than you bargained for; soul-crushing sadness, always confused, always hesitant, ALWAYS hungry. Trust me, it is possible to get so hungry that you eventually just… stop. And it’s not the hunger that stops - it’s your life; you’ll forget what happiness is, you’ll forget what this world has to offer, you’ll forget about what you already have. One morning when you comb your hair and find most of it on the floor, or your skin feeling like the surface of a dry desert when you run your hand over it, you’ll wish that it wasn’t so. You still have time to change. You aren’t done yet. You aren’t done until your final breath. There is more to life than pleasing people by torturing yourself. I did that far too much for far too long and STILL people complained. Just stop. If you don’t think you’re beautiful, it’s okay. I just want you to be at peace with yourself. But I think you’re the most beautiful thing I have ever known. And I don’t know what you look like. But the fact that you exist is in itself a thing of beauty. 


Destroy the idea that women who get eating disorders are ditzy and self-absorbed  

I feel ~very~ uncomfortable posting this but this is my bikini body. I don’t have abs, hell, my stomach is not flat. My legs touch and are far from skinny. I’ve been away and haven’t worked out in days. However, this is my body, this is my home for my entire life, and I have to learn to accept it and then love it. 

so, i changed my url. i do not want to be my eating disorder, and I refuse to let myself be reduced to it. my recovery, my awareness work, my desires to help others - they are part of who I am. But that’s the thing: they are part of me, but not all of me. Who I am, is wild. And I am determined to embrace it.so if you need me, you can find me at embracingwild :-)

Just a little project I’m working on. 

Michelle PahlYou got up this morning, stretched and staggered into the kitchen. Depending on your preference, you waited impatiently for coffee or tea, and then set about completing your morning routine. Maybe you’re a breakfast eater. Maybe not. You showered, got dressed and got ready to face the day, either at work or at home, again depending on where you are in your life. Lunch time rolled around and you were hungry, so you grabbed some food. An all-in-one meal from a fast food restaurant, or maybe you made yourself a sandwich. You were hungry a little later so you had some chips and a soda. You were going to make something for dinner, but friends called, so you headed out to the pub for some appetizers and dinner, maybe a beer or two. Once back at home, you did a few chores, watched some TV, grabbed another snack and once you were tired, you headed off to bed. As you were brushing your teeth, you realized you didn’t get in any exercise, but figured you’d get to it tomorrow, no big deal. You didn’t count calories. You didn’t give much thought to what you ate. You didn’t beat yourself up and call yourself foul names because you didn’t exercise. It never once occurred to you to throw up your dinner. You lived your day complete with food and friends because that’s how you do life. It’s what would be considered “normal.”I haven’t had a day like that since I was 11 years old and since I’m 46 now, that’s a long time to go without touching normal.I’ve met people over the course of my life that, once they learn I have an eating disorder, are eager to share the story of their own forays down that dark path. They talk about how they “used to be bulimic” because one summer at camp a group of them all decided to throw up their dinner every day, but then once they got home, they were cured. The talk about how they “used to be anorexic” because once, for a month, they ate only fruit and lost 15 pounds, but then they stopped and were cured. The anecdotes go on and on.It seems that some people, except those afflicted, want to lay claim to an eating disorder. Implicit in their stories is the question why; why can’t I stop if they did? Believe me, if I could have stopped, I would have. If I could’ve changed my thought patterns so that every moment wasn’t an exercise in self-hatred, I would have. Those conversations enrage me. Trying on some bad eating behaviors for a period and then abandoning them is not the same as having an eating disorder.When I broke up with my first love, I rebounded into alcohol and reckless behavior. A lot of alcohol. However, after a couple of months of getting drunk every weekend, of living with the hangovers and the empty wallet and the spotty memory, I’d had enough. I stopped. Drinking with reckless enthusiasm for a couple of months is not the same as being an alcoholic. It meant that I acted badly for a couple of months and then straightened up. I have yet to “straighten up” from my eating disorder. But my point is this: a few months of aberrant eating does not mean you have an eating disorder. For that, count yourself lucky.I am currently five months “sober.” That means, for the last five months, I’ve eaten relatively normally; three meals and a couple of snacks every day, no excessive exercising, no vomiting. This is the longest I have been abstinent of eating disorder behavior (excluding the three months I spent at a rehab, and even there I restricted somewhat) since I was 19.An eating disorder is not a game. An eating disorder is hell. It has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. It’s starving yourself until you can’t sleep, until you can’t think, until you can’t do anything but think about the next allotment of food. It’s driving around in your car from fast-food restaurant to fast-food restaurant, spending $20 at a time, shoving the food down your throat so fast it has no taste and then vomiting until the blood vessels in your eyes burst. It’s lying to everyone about your eating patterns and weight loss and weight gain. It’s learning to shop at a variety of different food stores so no one is aware of how much you’re buying. It’s lying to cashiers about this or that upcoming party so they don’t question the cakes and ice cream. It’s exercising for four hours straight and still hating yourself for the flesh on your bones. It’s thousands and thousands of dollars spent on food you throw up, exercise equipment you abuse and products to hide the evidence – air fresheners, breath mints and garbage bags for when you have to throw up in your room. It’s eating for an hour and throwing up for an hour, over and over for days on end until you pass out. It’s vomiting until there’s blood coming up from your lacerated esophagus and seeping from the infected sores on your hands. It’s shoplifting laxatives, water pills and mouthwash so that no one knows how much of them you use. It’s ulcers in your stomach, a devastated bone density and teeth rotting and falling out. It’s the knowledge you’re killing yourself and being desperate to stop, but continuing the behavior anyway. It’s starving yourself for a month and then binging for three days straight, vomiting until you pass out. It’s suicidal thoughts and attempts. It’s feeling like you can’t live in the hell your life has become.What isn’t it? It isn’t a transitory thing you try on. It isn’t a crash diet. It’s not the same as that time you had the stomach flu for a whole weekend. It’s doctors who don’t understand you, nurses who deride you, emergency room personnel who judge you and ambulance drivers who think you’re wasting their time. It’s a family you are devastating and friends who beg you to get help because everyone is watching you kill yourself slowly. It’s wanting help, but to accept it would mean you’d get “fat,” and to you, that would make you just as much a failure as you already are.It’s hell.But I’m five months free of my behavior. The other side, all the underlying crap that drives the behavior, that’s harder. I struggle to believe I have value if I’m not skeletal. I struggle to believe people actually care about me; that they will like me even if I’m not perfect. I struggle with my voice, the one thing I want to learn to share. I want to be authentic; I want to say “to hell with you” to the people out there that judge, and criticize and detract. I want to grow a thick skin. I want to be able to say I love myself, I’m happy with myself and I’m an OK person — and believe it.But for now, for today, I will take the five months and consider myself blessed.

24.05.19//Today’s act of kindness towards myself:I have booked a ticket to go to the cinema to see the new Aladin film (I have had a giftcard hanging around in my purse for ages and what with it being half term next week there was no way I was going to even attempt to go when it will be busy. Today will hopefully be quieter). So I am going to go and let myself “be” and lose myself in the world of Disney for a little bit. I refuse to feel guilty about this. nope.nope.nope. lalala. THIS IS OKAY. 

When friends talk about their body image and caloric intake around me and won’t stop even when I try to change the subject 

LookI have a little less than 4 months until school starts. I have 4 months to change, to restrict, fast, lose weight so that when school starts, i will be going into my senior year dainty and pretty.

I’m not recovered. I’m not. Not yet. But I’m further than I was a year a go. I’m further than I was a month ago. A week a go. Even yesterday. Everyday I face another challenge. Everyday I am a little bit closer to being “recovered”. Everyday I get a little bit of Eliza back. And I fucking love that. 

i am working every single day to bring more light into this world, to fight for myself, to be open, to laugh more, to breathe more, to be more, to love more, to rest more, to see more, and to apologize less. It is not easy, especially after weeks like this week where it is nothing but bad news after bad news. But I am growing and I am learning and I am determined and I do not need to let darkness in. I can acknowledge it, and it can visit, but I can still bring light. I will be the light.  and i think it’s one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. 

🕊 

29/05/19 update #1I’m getting to my GW and I’m super excited about it. I hope everything will continue to go fine and I won’t gain. I’m a little bit nervous, because my dad is coming home from work tommorow (he works abroad for a few weeks and then comes back for one or two) and I’m scared he’ll pressure me to eat more or will make comments about my eating or weight. I can only hope everything will be good. I’ll maybe just hide my body in bigger clothing and hopefully he or anyone else won’t notice my weight loss. Wish me luck.  

Here’s the teaI want to recover. I’m eating less than 900 calories a day. I cannot even control it anymore. You know what? I can’t even do a sit up or a push up. I literally feel my bones are gonna break. And I’m not even skinny, I’m 5,3 and weight 56kg. I’m not. My knees crack every time I stand up, my wrists crack and my heart feels funny. That’s it. Fuck anorexia. Fuck you. I’m going to therapy, this is fuckin it, I cannot believe I can’t run. I want to get married and I want to have kids. If my calcium deficiency goes on I won’t be able to, neither if my body keeps on sucking protein from my heart. Big fuck you. My life sucks but I’m gonna get out of this shit ass country and go to college and have a nice life. That’s it. Goodbye. I’m getting help. 

How my day is going…I skipped 2nd block to get high in the bathroom because weed is one of the only things that makes me feel better. I feel really lightheaded but I’m planning on staying under 100 calories today.  

So I’ve been in a residential eating disorder clinic for three weeks, after being in hospital for two weeks and I’m almost weight restored. Looks like I’m going to have to start from square one and now all eyes are on me.

Update:
14 days clean and sober
Been working for a month 
Finally have a therapist who sees me for me 

having body fat is human and shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of or insecure about ❤️ 

It’s 90 degrees in NC…I’m wrapped up in the largest, warmest, coziest sweater I own. Bundled tightly in my striped knit cocoon. Knee high socks to keep my legs warm, because I just had to challenge myself to not wear “sick clothes” today. Damn this house is cold. I make another cup of tea. The thermostat reads 75°F. That can’t be right. I blame the AC. I blame sitting around. I blame running. I blame my genetics. It’s not my fault. Right? I make a snack and sip my tea, shrugging off my sweater and my guilt. I break into a sweat now with each bite.  How strange. The same story repeats itself every day. The sweater, the tea, the long pants I hide behind. I eat. I sweat. I pretend. It’s not my fault. I don’t know why. Everything-is-fine. It’s 90 degrees in North Carolina and I’m freezing cold all the damn time. Maybe I really do have anorexia.  

When people ask me why I keep relapsing into my eating disorder every time things get difficult in my life 

Breakfast: nothing-(0)Lunch: 1 package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/6 cup tomato sauce-(20)Dinner: 1 package seaweed snacks-(30), ½ package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/3 flavoring packet-(5)Total Intake: 95 caloriesToday was a really shitty day and I feel like a whale. I was going to go for a walk but I threw up and still feel sick so I’m just going to do some light exercise at home.   

why do i think restricting my eating will solve all my problems? 

My biggest stumbling block in my recovery has been grocery shopping. On the weekend when I was visiting my dad, I went shopping with him and realised all the fun I’d been missing out on, and the fond memories.Things I’m missing out on1. A weird side kick thing to get the other while walking side by side2. Dad ‘accidentally’ pushing me into the aisles and then proceed to announce how clumsy I am3. Dad yelling ‘BINGO’ when he’s number is called at the Deli4. Me pretending to be a banana then jumping up and down saying ‘Pick me, I’m single’5. Dad opening a packet of twisties and eating them before getting to the checkout6. Dad getting an iced coffee and then my younger siblings demanding their right to a chocolate milk7. My sister and I putting food into the trolley and then having to guard it with our lives so dad doesn’t put it back on a shelf when we’re not looking8. Telling Dad that no, he doesn’t need another packet of parmesan cheese, spaghetti or Jatz biscuits 

It’s really hard to make new recipes when Every site posts the nutrition. It’s very discouraging.. 

The next time you take a bunch of selfies to post one, don’t pick the one where you look the thinnest.  Pick a different one even if you think it’s not the best one.  Protest the hissy fit that says that you just “LIKE THE THIN ONE BEST.” Practice not making thin your priority.  Even if that means posting your second-favorite selfie.

People really underestimate how much strength it takes to recover from an eating disorder. Seriously, you’re all absolutely fucking awesome. 

Skinny is not all it’s cracked up to be.
I know you think it’s what you want right now- your head is trying to convince you thin is equivalent to happiness, confidence, freedom.
There’s no freedom in this disease. No smiles, no incredible self esteems. 
We’re all broken, and we continue to crack and crumble.
Your hair becomes straw, falling out effortlessly.
Your skin becomes ghostly, jaundice even.
Your cheeks and cute chin grow hair from hormone imbalance and malnutrition (it’s called lanugo).
Even after becoming physically healthier, the doctor tells me I’ve fractured my sacrum. From running and walking. 
Two weeks later and I’ve been experiencing a sharp pain in the opposite side of my body at my hip. From just being alive, I suppose.
I type this as I sit in a dentist office, my tooth decided to fall out this weekend. What’s calcium? My body doesn’t know.
I’m falling to pieces, still. Every day, apparently. 
Skinny is not all it’s cracked up to be.
anorexia is not beautiful. 

When you want to lose weight but know you can’t…

Tbh a major thing about recovery is nobody is going to kiss your scars, nobody is going to fight your demons for you, you need to pull yourself back together, and build back the strength you need to overcome the battles that are trying to bring you down; this is your fight and only you can win it 

Not too long ago, I held a round table with some very impressive people who are using their platforms to shatter the stigma around mental illness and substance misuse. Joanna was there, and she spoke so eloquently about the need to share our mental health challenges. She said sharing our stories “spreads awareness like wildfire”. This is her story.When I first began to struggle
with an eating disorder,
 I didn’t know that what I was experiencing had a name. All I knew was 
that food made me extremely anxious and I was terrified of gaining
weight. Because
 I didn’t know that these were hallmarks of an eating disorder, I kept 
my behaviors around food hidden for more than a decade.
I was afraid that no one would believe me if I asked for help. I assumed
 that I would be told to “get over it”—that I was just being dramatic, 
just seeking attention, just going through a phase. Eating
 disorders are not a phase you outgrow; in fact, without treatment, they
 often get worse. My eating disorder began as a way to cope
with problems at home—if I was focused on counting calories and losing 
weight, then I wasn’t focused on the negativity around me. Over time, 
though, these coping behaviors turned into full-blown anorexia
and bulimia with comorbid depression, anxiety, and a substance use disorder. By
 the time I finally sought help at the age of 25, I was exhausted in 
body, mind, and spirit. A therapist told me that she feared I would
die, and I couldn’t even muster the energy to care. Eating
 disorders are not phases, extreme diets, overreactions, or 
attention-seeking ploys. They are mental illnesses with serious, 
life-threatening
consequences. More than 30
million Americans struggle with some form of these disorders, but the vast majority never seeks help. Many
 people suffer in silence because eating disorders are mired in stigma 
and misinformation. One pervasive myth is that only rich, young,
white women develop these disorders. In fact, eating disorders affect people
of every age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. They are biologically based mental illnesses, and current research suggests they may in part be genetically
determined. 
The good news is that it is possible to fully recover from an eating disorder—and the sooner you act, the better your chances.  
Feb.
 21 through 27 is National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. Across the 
country, individuals and organizations of all kinds are rallying
to bring eating disorders to the fore and urging people to seek help as 
soon as possible. The NEDAwareness website offers a free,
anonymous screening
 that can provide crucial information about whether your eating habits 
or thoughts about weight and body image are healthy or unhealthy.  
I strongly encourage you to take three minutes to do the screening or to pass the link along to friends and family members. You do not have to fight this battle by yourself. There are resources available, and there is hope. 
You are not alone.  
To get screened or to find out more information about eating disorders, visit
the official NEDAwareness website.

For the past couple of weeks I’ve been stuck in this under eating (not restricting really but not eating enough) and over eating (not binging but eating more than I should). I can’t help but want to lose weight again, and I even have been trying to do so, but then the next day I feel guilty for doing that and eat more. I’ve also been really depressed lately and feeling really unworthy so my ed has been resorting to either restricting or binging as a coping mechanisms.I feel like crap about it, someone got any advice? I know I should stop counting calories but I just can’t help it, it makes me (well my ed rather) feel safe. Ugh, recovery is hard. 
“not pro only using tags”Bitch who you tryin to fool?  
My self esteem is so low.. I woke up and cried because honestly, putting so much into your apperence just to be called fat and ugly is draining.  
Friend:
                                                what did you eat today?                    Me:

Best thing about being overweight when you’re restricting or fasting?  People don’t get suspicious when you decline food they offer you. (｡･ω･｡)

hi, there is no correlation between your weight & your worth 

The hardest thing to hear when you’re weight restored from an eating disorder is, “oh, so you’re cured now?”It always fills us with an odd feeling. The feeling that our emotions and thoughts are no longer valid as we are no longer underweight. But, I just wanted to remind you that:You can still have an eating disorder if you’re at a healthy weight or if you are overweight.Your thoughts are valid.It is okay to express how you are feeling.You are such a wonderful person, who has fought so damn hard to get to where you are now, don’t let any comments take that away from you. 

one day you’ll wake up early and look out your window and the birds will be singing and the sun will be shining and you won’t care about the calories in your coffee and you will be okay. everything will be okay. 

Me: *eats 3 full meals 3 days in a row*Me: *isn’t extremely hungry 24/7*Me: 

if you’re trans and you have a restrictive ed please remember that your body does not have to be small to pass. you’re perfect the way you are and you losing weight will not cure your dysphoria. you’re just gonna end up dysphoric and ill. the control an eating disorder pretends to give you is fake and please don’t let it take until you’re in the hospital because you blacked out going up some stairs to realize that. 

Self care is figuring out what lies behind the triggers. What’s really upsetting you? Soul search. Dig deep. Figure out what’s wrong so you can begin to heal.  

the way your family treats you is not a reflection of who you are. you are not a bad person. please don’t forget that. you are not a bad person.  

Scabs arent pretty.minusthenegative.com  

my ed: makes me feel bad for being bloatedmy stomach: thanks me for being nourishedmy brain: thanks me for being nourishedmy heart: thanks me for being nourishedmy bones: thank me for being nourishedall my internal organs: thank me for being nourished 

Nobody: Me: CLIMATE! CHANGE! IS! REAL! STOP! USING! SO! MUCH! PLASTIC! 

unpopular opinions:depression sucksanxiety isnt cuteanorexia is not an aesthetic and nobody wants mental illnesses  

when recovering from a restrictive ed, gaining weight is strength. it is recovery; it is living. if you think you look “fat” today, remember that’s what ana wants you to think. it’s not bad to gain, it’s necessary. don’t be scared, try to love yourself 

recovery tip!recovery doesn’t have to be perfect aesthetic foods all the time!!! eat what you want!!! eat messy pizza and burgers it’s okay! not all recovery looks the same and your food doesn’t have to be instagram perfect for you to eat it! 

you know what!!!! i wasn’t born to be skinny!!!!! my body wasn’t meant to be skinny!!!! and that doesn’t mean my body isn’t beautiful!!!!!  

something that’s stuck with meseeing people recovered on instagram. and not ‘recovered’, but actually embracing how they look and eating freely — cake, pizza, ice cream, yet also salads, fruits, veggies.they’re proof that recovery is REAL and that it’s WORTH IT.if recovery wasn’t worth it like your eating disorder tells you, then why have these people stayed recovered when they could have gone back? why would they not return to their eating disorder if it was as shit as our ed’s tell us?because it isn’t. it’s worth it, and these people are proof. proof that you can succeed without it, proof that you can be happy without it, proof that you DON’T NEED IT. 

☆*:.｡. reminder .｡.:*☆Body dysmorphia is VERY real. Don’t forget that your self image may be distorted.Your flaws aren’t visible to everyone. Love yourself even if it’s hard.  

If you’re reading this, it’s a sign to go eatEven if you don’t think you’re hungry ‘enough’. Even if you think you’ve already ate too many calories.I know how it feels to be anxious about eating and feeling like you don’t deserve the food. Every now and again I get some thoughts telling me not to eat. But please nourish your body, it needs food!Go eat, you deserve it. You deserve good things. 

How do people expect us to recover?When everywhere we go, we’re surrounded by diets, weight loss pills, calories, nutritional content and the constant pressure to Just. Be. Thin. At every party, someone doesn’t finish their plate, cause they’re saving space for dessert they say. Before a wedding the bride goes on a strict diet, cause the dress has to fit. Little girls stop eating their favorite sweets, encouraged by their mother, cause candy makes you fat, they say. Losing weight seems like all life is about, like the only purpose anyone has is to look good in a bathing suit.So how can we recover? 

their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  

Every time I choose recovery over my ed I picture my organs cheering for me. So when I chose to eat breakfast this morning, my stomach did a little celebration. It’s a fun little recovery quirk that works for me, and might work for you 🌸 

me: I look good today-my ED: you look like this 

Healing doesnt happen how you expect, but that means theres a chance itll happen better. minusthenegative.com  

You deserve to travel to another country you’ve always dreamed of visiting. To walk the streets, sipping on a pleasant drink unfamiliar to someone of your culture. To stop for a mid morning and afternoon snack, not because you’re necessarily hungry, but because you see a fantastic baked good in the café window that would bring a smile to your face and please your tourist body and mind. You deserve to sit down for a reservation at a restaurant that appears at the top of the list of best places to eat in that country. To start the meal with a thick slice of their locally baked bread with a slab of butter on top. To order a local favorite you’ve never tried before. To drizzle an unusual but intriguing sauce on top that the waiter swears is to die for. To have the waiter persuade you into taking a local favorite dessert back to your hotel room. To sit in the hotel loveseat facing the window view and eat it slowly, taking in the city. You deserve to travel without an eating disorder. You deserve to live without an eating disorder, and experience every joy life has to offer.

ANOREXIA IS A BITCH, SO I WAS A BITCHsomething that isnt spoken about a whole loti became the BiGgEsT bitch eVeR when Ed came out. i screamed, cried, puched, kicked, scratched, threw food, poured shit all over the floor/table, swore like no ones ever heard at my family, called them things i would never forgive myself for, all because of my eating disorder.eating disorders arent ‘fragile’ or ‘shy’ or any other stereotypical stigmatised image the media has placed in your head; it was true horror.i dont think i could ever forgive myself for what this has put my family and friends through, but i have to keep remembering that it wasnt me, it was Ed.soPLEASE👏🏼STOP👏🏼THINKING👏🏼ED’S👏🏼ARENT👏🏼DESPITEFUL👏🏼TO👏🏼OTHERS👏🏼 

Me: *has the chance to skip dinner*My brain: don’t eat. u were already fat to begin with and u’ve done nothing but gain weight recently. u should feel bad about all of the stuff u’ve already had today. u must be faking anorexia if it’s so easy for you to eat. u r disgusting and should die.Me: you were just telling me I was stupid for being anorexic just a minute ago! and now you’re encouraging it! I cAn’T tRuSt AnYtHiNg YoU sAy AnYmOrE!!! 

It’s been1 whole year of recovery today. Recovering from disordered eating is not an easy path. It is a lot of ups and downs, relapsing, fighting, setbacks and hard work. It’s a slow, slow battle. But I would never want to go back to where I was and I wish to encourage people to follow my lead. Always feel free to message me.  

 

Lets process your process.minusthenegative.com  

just ur friendly psa!• ‘anorexic’ isnt an adjective• not all eds are anorexia• just because theyre eating again or more, doesnt mean theyre recovered• on that note, just because theyve gained weight doesnt mean theyre recovered either• it isnt their fault for having an ed• also on that note, it isnt ur fault for them having an ed either• ur not a ‘fake’ for eating or not using behaviours• relapse is a normal thing for an ed recovery, but that doesnt mean u should stop trying to recover• if there are other mental health problems present, pls acknowledge them as well as they could be preventing recovery/making recovery harder• it isnt always ‘just wanting to be thin’• someone can look like they are doing well, but they could actually be in the middle of a relapse and are screaming for help• if we refuse food, dont get angry at us bc that just makes the illness angry and we will react badly• dont get angry. fullstop.• physical restoration doesnt mean ur not valid for treatment, outpatient or inpatientpls feel free to add on! 

Took a selfie today and was kinda feeling, so I thought why not post it for @postitforward Mental Health Month! Make sure you join in their movement as the tasks change every week- ending stigma is a big feat but together- we can do it! Now go and do some good shiz 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

I am tired of being hungry, I am tired of excuses not to go out, I am tired of searching up numbers on plastic bags, I am tired of the taste of water, coffee and green tea, I am tired of letting myself down, I am tired of punishing myself every time I eat, I am tired of punching myself on the stomach every time I feel full, I am tired of smelling like vomit because of what I did on the bathroom, I am tired of looking at skeleton girls wishing I was them.There are so many reasons why I want to recover…. I felt trapped here on this blog because I have 6k people following me here and I know this number will go down with this decision but I don’t care (actually I do because this means that you don’t want to recover and I want you to recover but oh well….). You are all so important to me and I know how hard this living hell is, this is why im fighting against it. And you can do this too because if I can do this you can!! I believe in everyone here and I believe WE can be happy without ana. Right now she is screaming in my head saying that I can do this to her, that I have to be thin and pretty and look like a sick person so people can worry about me but I am telling her to fuck off. Guys you can always message me and I will always be here for y'all! Send me a question or ask for any tips on recovery! I will also post here what I do to motivate myself when Im down or pics of my recovery journal (and poetry as always)! Loads of love and kisses for u!! Stay safe (FOR REAL) and go eat that piece of cake you wanted so bad) :))) 

listen up disordered folki have been informed of some pretty shitty stuff happening in the community, and here are a few common sense remindersdon’t post body checks if you are under 18dont fucking send anon hate to others, i stg if i find out ur calling other ppl fat on anon i will throw handsdont tell people in recovery shit about their weight or how they shouldnt recover. remember, hands will be thrownblock creepy peopledelete the hate and go on with your daydont give out tips, idiotsdont fucking write meanspo and say its for yourself, if it were, it would be private!!!!!!! be kind!!! and welcoming!!!! not so hard to do!!!!!ignore people who are assholesblur out your face from body checksdont fast for more than 3 days my dudes its dangerous af, especially if you are already malnourishedok that was all, please use common sense and i know there are a lot of kids there so i just wanted to remind yall of what i thought was obvious!!! stay safe bitches!!!!!!  

Are you new to this community? Leave. Are you trying to recover? Leave. Do you want to live? L E A V E. I promise, you do not want this. Today I fainted twice. Twice. I threw up five times; I physically can’t handle food anymore, my body rejects it as if it were poison. I’m so weak- I can hardly stand up. My hair keeps falling out, every morning I find chunks of hair on my pillow. I keep having the worst headaches imaginable and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m so so so scared. I know I’m dying- I can feel my body shutting down and the worst part is knowing it’s too late to go back. So please, just leave. Survive for all of those who couldn’t.  

If you had a bad day, a bad week, or heck even a bad year…Reblog this, drop an anon, or comment- I will text every single one of you 

Glorify recoveryGlorify full meals, a good nights rest, and doing your best. Glorify making the consious decision to be better. Glorify the daily struggles to do whats best and ignore the evil whispers your disorder wants you to trust. Glorify winning those little, silent victories. Glorify feeling warm, full, and refreshed. Glorify health and happiness and caution. Recovery can be beautiful if we rest during our bad days and rejoice on our good days. Weather you are moving up or down, you are still moving forward. Glorify recovery, not illness.  

some things i have learnt about eating disorder recovery:
- if a food makes you happy or you crave it a lot, have some! depriving yourself of food is just gonna make you crave it more and when you finally snap you will binge eat 10x more bad things than if you just had this one small thing
- recovery takes time !!! lots of time !! ive had my ed for 5 years and ive fallen in and out of recovery and its hard but it is doable!!! 
- ive lost more weight nourishing my body with healthy things and exercising a few times a week than i ever did starving myself
- self love is not a sudden thing. no one wakes up entirely in love with themselves. it takes time and energy and yes ! its okay not to like certain things about yourself but they make you unique and most of the time they cant be changed and thats okay!!!
- thigh gaps r not for everyone!!! not everyone can achieve a thigh gap! it completely depends on your bone structure, you could be at the lowest weight possible and still not have a thigh gap because of your bone structure but thats okay! thigh gaps do not determine your worth as a human (but if you do have a thigh gap thats fine too! everyones bodies are different)
- eat more fruit and veggies!!! honestly!!! blend them in a smoothie or cook them or eat them with chocolate, who cares!!! they will help ur skin, ur hair and ur mood as well as many other benefits. try and eat at least 2 or 3 portions a day because yes theyre expensive and not everyone can manage 5 a day. 
- u are allowed to treat urself with unhealthy food!!! ur body is smart and can cope with u eating a slice of cake or a bar of chocolate
- u should not fear food!!! food is ur friend!!! especially healthy foods, but also unhealthy foods for when u need them.
- throwing up your food does more damage than it ever will do good. it is so bad for ur emotional and physical well being and is found to make u gain more weight than lose it ! 
- u shouldnt feel the need to lose weight. if u want to do it in a healthy way thats ur choice but people see more in you than just a number or a body i promise
- your ed will not vanish overnight. it takes months, maybe years of recovery to feel fully recovered but you can get better everyday and it will be so worth it when you look back and think about how far u have come !!! ❤️ 

NEDAweek🌸✨🌸✨🌸✨🌸✨🌸✨It’s officially national eating disorder awareness week, please use this week as an opportunity to spread awareness and positivity for eating disorders, instead of using this week for the wrong reasons, stay strong everybody<3 

Since you need and excess of 3500 calories to increase (or decrese) 1 pound of fat, and since 1 kg is equal to 2.20462 lbs (according to Google), you need to consume 7716.17 calories to increase your weight by 1 kg.

Let me show you what 7716.17 calories a day looks like-:absolutely no movement in between:10 slices of pizza- 293610 slices of white bread- 53010 apples- 5206 eggs- 4603 chocolate muffins- 10922 coffee frappes- 1078500 grams chocolate ice-cream- 1080Caesar salad- 550PLUS eating whatever your RMR is (For Men : 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x Age + 5 = RMR ||| For Women : 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x Age – 161 = RMR)So keep this is mind lovelies and stay safe, stay calm and message me if you need to talk  

Anorexia is..Anorexia is thinking about what you will eat next 24 hours a dayAnorexia is not being able to look in the mirror without disgust and guiltAnorexia is hating yourself for eating the amount of calories that are recommended for someone your age and genderAnorexia is not wearing a jacket in the winter because the cold makes you thinnerAnorexia is not sleeping at night because you are constantly thinking about how to loose all these calories that were too much todayAnorexia is exercising so much that it hurtsAnorexia is never being enough for anything, anyone and most importantly not for yourselfAnorexia is taking cold baths and showers even though you already feel cold all the timeAnorexia is hiding your feelings from everyone around you because you don’t want to seem weakAnorexia is being ashamed of eating so little and starving yourself even though there are people in this world who have nothing to eatAnorexia is drinking so much water that you feel sick from itAnorexia is thinking that you are not worth all the good things that other people can eatAnorexia is always caring about others and forgetting about yourselfAnorexia is planing and organising, checking everything twiceAnorexia is wanting others to accept and like you but actually it is about you wanting to like yourselfAnorexia is having panic attacks over meals you haven’t cooked yourself or not knowing what’s inside themAnorexia is feeling disgusting when others see you eat Anorexia is depressionAnorexia is hopelessnessAnorexia is an illnessAnd it is never to late to get help// This is what anorexia nervosa is for me, everyone is different and every eating disorder is different // 



Avocado and Pasta recipe
A simple recipe I’ve seen on Instagram, creamy and tasty, filling and surprisingly low in calories per portions.
You will need:
2 Avocados, or 1 big one
50gr of cream
1 clove of garlic 
2 ounces of spaghetti 
8 pieces of bacon, chopped into small cubes
30gr of cheese or any substitute you have
Put the avocados, cream and garlic in a blender and blend the lot till its creamy. Season to your taste. 
On the side, put the pasta to boil in salted water.
Chop your bacon and cook it in a skillet/pan, until crispy, and get rid of the oil. If you want, you can lay the bits of bacon on paper towels to get rid of as much oil as possible.
Once the pasta is done, strain it and put it back in the pit you cooked it in.
Add the avocado mixture and the bacon and mix well. 
Season to taste, add cheese if wanted, and you’re set to go!

recovery is the toughest yet most rewarding thing i could achieve and it will be SO worth it in the end 

one day I will not look at the nut butter isle and be overwhelmed and flooded with anxiety. one day I will buy more than one jar of different flavors that I’d like to try. one day I will wake up and spread my choices on my choice of bread or pastry and sip my coffee and not give it a second thought. today is not that day. but the day will come.  

Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if?

i’m wearing an outfit today that i don’t feel comfortable in at all- everybody can see that i’m losing/have lost most of my thigh gap. and at first glance? i feel like crying. i grab the fat on my thighs as tears slip down. but you know what? i didn’t take off that outfit. because A THIGH GAP IS NOT RELEVANT TO MY GOALS AND DREAMS. IT DOESNT HELP ME ACHIEVE ANYTHING. I AM MORE THAN THE THIGH GAP I MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE!!!!! i’m losing my thigh gap, but i’m gaining freedom!!!! trust from my parents!!!! self love!!!!!! i’m reaching my goals!!!!! so honestly? goodbye thigh gap. you caused me so much suffering. it’s time for you to go.  

Pause. Close your eyes. Take a breath. Hear your beating heart. You are alive and deserve to be here. Never doubt your worth. Today is a perfect day to love yourself. @madsrecovers  

Did you know??When you eat enough and feed your body the nutrients it needs, your mood improves, your skin clears, you don’t pass out every time you get up and your mind isn’t fuzzy anymore?Ikr, it was shocking for me too. 

 

if you find yourself asking whether or not you should eat {thing},the answer is ALWAYS eat. if you’re struggling with having a second cookie, or if you think your not hungry enough for seconds but it just tastes so good, eat it!! eating without any restriction at all is so important in recovery

i am more. i am more than the the calories i consume. i am more than the inches around my waist. i am more than the chub on my tummy. i am more than the size of my pants. i am more than my eating disorder. i am so much more.  

friendly reminder that you made it until this point in your life. you went through so many struggles and you’re still here. i’m so proud of you, keep fighting 🌞💛💫🌻

Weight restored 🌜🌛 

copingsometimes, recovery isn’t even moving forward, it’s just coping, and not moving backwards. sometimes, it’s just admiring how far you’ve come❤️ 

im fasting til i get under 110lbs, i swear no more fucking around,its skinny season  

it was never about being pretty. it was always about being less. the beginning / krc 

hey youyou can do this i believe in you 

I want to make something clear: I do what I do because I LOVE my body. I am recovering from serious mental illnesses and I am excited to grow my incredibly strong body. Our bodies process everything differently, your body is different from mine, what I’m doing might not work for you and what works for you might not work for me. You have to LOVE your bodies. It’s the only way to do anything healthily. Take days off. Eat that piece of cake. Rest. This life is too fucking short to worry about our bodies appearance 24/7. Looking great is a side effect of a healthy lifestyle, it is not the purpose of what I do. I want to gain strength, I want to gain a better relationship with food. I want to love my body the way it deserves to be loved. Live your damn life and give yourself a break every once and a while. Don’t fucking go to the gym because you despise your flesh, go to the gym because you love your body. 

6 weeks into recovery- 🎈Guess who just got their period back🎈!!!!Man I don’t think I’ve ever been so happy to see blood in my life… 🎊🎉🎈 fuck I’m so relieved

I believe in you. the world believes in you. you can do it, you can make it through the day. you are divine. 

I am chubby and squishy and soft, and that is ok. I’m big because I’m filled with love, happy memories, and yummy food. I’m tubby and I’m living my life, not just surviving✨ 

 

Rome wasn’t built in a dayAnd there probably we’re alot of mistakes that happened too. Just give yourself time and things will change. 

May 2016- August 2017 
This is my currently physique. I’ve been pretty absent lately, life got busy as it does and I didn’t have the time I used to. 
I’m presently instructing spin full time while starting up the semester full time wth school. Throughout the summer- my bulking was put on pause due to hectic training for spin. I dropped about 10 pounds in the process. Now that my schedule is evening out, I have a bit more time to focus on building muscle and fueling properly for it. 
My plan: head face deep into a second bulking season, build back up to at least 140lbs, develop a solid routine between meals, work outs, spin, and school. 
I’ve missed you all!  
Xoxo 

little helpful things you can do before going to bed:- get a glass of water in case you get thirsty during the night- pack your bag- write a to-do list- plan what you’ll wear tomorrow- make lunch for the next day (& breakfast if you want!)- wash and moisturise your face 



 

I’m up two pant sizes since I last bought real jeans (a few years) but I’m not too mad ‘cause I’m still cute af. 

wouldn’t it be lovely? 

a daily reminder that it’s okay to take up space  



Recovery blog 30th May 2019
For those of you who have been following a while, you will rememeber my recovery blogs which I unfortunately stopped due to a relapse. However, today I’m restarting this mini series, as I plan to fully recover this time.
This morning I started off my day amazingly - I had 2 slices of toast with honey and cinnamon, and some earl grey tea. I then proceeded to watch Pretty Woman - I loved it!
For lunch I threw together some pasta and sauce, because I wasn’t up for making too much today. I finished my movie then danced in my kitchen. A lot.
For dinner, my dad brought me home a pizza, which I was unable to finish, but still ate some of.
For every meal, I ate a fear food, and I’m so proud! Hello again, recovery. 


I think it is important that this be talked about. Even if its a painful topic, PLEASE if you have anorexia hear me out. 

I’m not sure if anyone even reads these things I make, or even the comments I add here and there on certain posts….. does anyone? I get little response if any, but if I can help even one person, I’ll keep doing it.That being said, I have not been able to afford any medical help for my anorexia, or anything like that. I had to start pulling myself out of the hole of anorexia when my body became so weak and fragile. I had no choice, or it was a state hospital. Now, I see a dietician who weighs me weekly and gives me challenges. I may not be fully recovered, but Ive come far on my own and with the help of a few loved ones. I had to get a long series of tests done to see how my body was, after my period stopped for over a year I HAVE SEEN GIRLS on pro ana sites and even here who say they are so glad their period is gone but you’d better hear me out and LEARNSo, in case you werent aware, a woman’s bone mass peaks once a months during her period. Without that peak period, your bones degrade over time. Pile on months of low bone mass and no calcium or minerals coming in, fats and vitamis especially. And what do you know, I have osteopenia. My spine is weak and I am at increased risk for fractures. I used to be a dancer, and a really dedicated one at that. Do you know how hard it was to watch the nutcracker this holiday with my parents, knowing I couldnt dance like that anymore? Not to mention, my ultrasounds show that I have multiple cysts on both ovaries from backlogs of missed cycles. This caused high testosterone, seriously bad acne and skin pigmentation and terrible mood swings. Now, If my period returns maybe it can slowly reverse. Maybe if I return to my old weight I will help my bones come back. If not? Well, God knows.  

I’m sorry guysI’m sorry guys, but I’ve decided to try and recover. This isn’t my first time trying and it probably won’t be my last, but I just need to try. I hate living like this, hating my body, killing myself slowly but surely.As such, I won’t be going into Tumblr for a long time, preferably never again. I hope that one day everyone in this community can feel good about themselves both physically and mentally and try recovery again too. You are all so kind and lovely and beautiful and handsome!!!Anyways, this is goodbye for now.Good luck everyone x 

Do you want to be the loving, successful, and compassionate woman you want to be, or do you want to be the girl that doesn’t eat?-my therapist 

So, please, this is a reminder that your brain needs nourishment to function properly! And I’m not talking about a little cracker or rice cake (although, if that’s all you can manage, cheers for you for trying your hardest!).Here’s some quick maths for you:The brain uses up around 20% of your Resting Metabolic Rate, which is, you guessed it, the energy your body uses when it’s at complete rest (so basically just the energy needed for breathing, etc). This is a bit different from BMR, but, honestly, for our calculations, let’s just use the BMR because it’s easier (in order to calculate your RMR you need to actually be put in a bed with oxygen masks and stuff attached to you - whereas you can calculate your BMR anywhere online).My BMR is around 1300-1400 calories (depending on the website you ask, for some reason). Let’s use 1350 because it’s the middle term.20% x 1350 = 270 caloriesThis is the minimum just for your brain to function. And we all know that the brain, besides doing all the thinking (which you’ll need), also controls all other parts of your body.So if you have exams coming up and you’re studying, please make sure you don’t eat below ~300 calories. It’ll help your brain function better and you’ll be able to focus and study!If you can’t manage that, it’s alright, I know it’s tough. But, if you can, try eating at least something before the actual exam (preferentially carbs - an apple, a rice cake, an energy bar, etc), to fuel your brain. It’ll be doing a lot of hard thinking, so be kind to it and give it something to work with.Please, stay safe, and please seek recovery if you can. Life is so much better when you’re not using your energy to calculate calories. If you need anything don’t hesitate to send me a message, I’m always here (even if Tumblr is dumb sometimes and doesn’t alert me of your messages). 

Autumn 🎃🍃🍁🌿 

Thanks voice i know im-  

Anyone else 22 or older and struggling with an ED?I’m seeing all these teens in the ana tags. Super sad, but it also makes me feel kind of alone. Is anyone else in their 20’s and still struggling? (My ED didn’t actually start til I was 20.  

I have a lot I need to catch you up on with my recovery, also a lot of feelings I need to get out. But for now, I’ll leave you with some positive. I haven’t counted calories in probably close to a month now, I’ve been enjoying a surplus of ice cream, and my mom will be celebrating her birthday twice and I have full intensions to eat cake both times, and enjoy the special meals they’ve prepared for the family, not restricting one for the other. Have a good Memorial Day.  







I made a mood board! It’s called “Me Thinking About Maybe Eating Food At School In Front Of Other Humans + bnha”

merry christmas to all those with eating disorders that will struggle a lot this holiday! i hope you all have the best day possible ❤️ 

me starting a new fast after binging again 

dear whoever is reading this, hello darling. i’m sorry the system has let you down. i’m sorry mental health is still a taboo topic, even though one in four people struggle with a mental illness. life can be hard, it can be draining and lonesome. you aren’t alone, it has been said a lot today, but it is true. you are not alone. these feelings you are feeling, this battle behind your eyes, this war you are fighting, others are facing similar things. today is a day created to spread awareness, but my mission is to spread awareness everyday. to tell you are you are valid and loved. to ask you to seek help. asking for a help isn’t a sign of weakness, it’s a sign of hope. hope is real, and coursing through you. guiding you to this point. asking for help is a sign of bravery, and courage. i am proud of you for making it to this point. I ask you to stay. with that being said, I am here for you. if you need to feel less alone, or need support, feel free to message me. you are not alone, others are fighting and surviving. you are a warrior. you are strong. stay.@shy-ghost-girl // world mental health day 

 

Challenge: Eat what I actually want over what my brain says is the “healthier” option.  

 





Big big fear food challenge: bakery goods without knowing and counting calories. White bread, cheese, sugar and sweet sauces.. All of this screams don’t eat it.
BUT GUESS WHAT ANA, I DID 🐝✨ 

Me: *has a small snack after fasting for 72 hours*ED:  

You know what?  When I’m older and I’m enjoying a birthday cake, or a fancy meal, or a holiday with family, friends and loved ones, I’m 100% positive I’ll look back on now and think ‘I’m so glad I didn’t give in and kept fighting" 

today my ED was very loud, telling me to skip breakfast and enjoy the hunger and feeling of control again. I might be going out for dinner so why would I need food now? but I stepped up, said fuck you to ana, and made some toast. 
I really want to recover 

Eating Disorders in People of colorEven today I’m still trying to get what I am. People look at me and tell me I am a person of color… which is weird because my whole life I grew up thinking I was white. My mom is white, I was raised among kids in a private school mostly white. I saw only white people in movies and tv. It never occurred to me.I remember when I went in to be evaluated for an eating disorder, they asked me why I wanted so much to be thin… I said because then I wouldn’t look like a chubby Latina anymore… but like a white woman. A white woman who has class and a chance out there..In a way, racism shaped my eating disorder… 

Nobody : Ana : you are too fat to be anorexic 



I feel like a goddess 😍 guys, please give recovery a try! The feeling of true unconditional self love is amazing. I know it feels impossible, but I promise you can do it. It takes a lot of effort, time, and energy. BUT ITS WORTH IT, okay? 

Throwing another Tumblr slumbr partyAll my girls, guys and nonbinary unicorns who wanna come are welcome. Let’s celebrate and be there for each other, and for a night forget our worries, cares and anxieties. All are welcome to my slumbr party, and yes you CAN sit with us. Activities of the night include:💟Find a picture of your dream pajamas, slippers or tiara that you sleep in and share it! 💟share something that happened this week, highs and lows?💟Ask memes and games💟Truth or Truth 

This night I had many very bad nightmares but I don’t remember them. I’m weak up crying and screaming but I don’t remember why. I have only a very bad mood now. And stomach ache.
 

 

I’m So TrIgGeRrEdDon’t you just love when you’re underweight (BMI of 15.6) but then when you want to recover and talk about gaining weight, someone tells you that no you don’t and they’d rather be your weight than what they are now.And how when people see how thin you are they want to be like you and not know all the complications that are along with that?Like ???¿¿¿¿Life is so hard 😭 like I wanna get better but guess not anymore huh 🤷‍♀️ 

Okay so this is a very impromptu post but I thought I’d share it because it’s such a big milestone…I got my period for the first time in eight months!And I ain’t even gonna censor this or anything because periods are normal and need be talked about in relation with ED’s.It might not seem big to everyone, but it’s big for me because it means that I’m fertile; my ED hasn’t taken away my chance to have children of my own (one of the shittest possibilities whilst having anorexia) in the future. I’m and incredibly happy- but in pain. Oh well. I don’t mind this time.  

Trying to flood my dashboard with positivity rn!So please, if you post self-love and acceptance stuff and/or ED recovery, reblog or like this post so that I can follow you!I’m feeling really down and beat atm, so I just kinda need some positivity in my life 

REMINDER: the more you restrict yourself the higher the chances of you eating more than recommended later on. this is basic science. your body will do this whether you like it or not. Do Not Restrict.

It’s there😍 I ordered a snack box full of tasty surprises from The Go Foods Company. There are so many amazing snacks in there and I can’t wait to try them🐝✨💕 

oh it the most wonderful time of the year……..because of all the delicious fruit.  

ed was worming it’s way into my head making me think and think about what my perfect first nutritious meal of the year will be that will set the tone for everything I eat the rest of the year and then I recognized how stupid that was and ate a frosted sugar cookie and vanilla latte happy new year lov urself

calorieless flavoured water
i thought other anas may like this, too.
so, there’s something called MiO water enhancer and it’s delicious. there’s two types;
there’s multiple flavours for both types, too.
sticking true to my word too, they both have no calories !! here’s the thing for the regular kind ( ignore my fat hands ) ;
and here’s thing for the sports;
i usually put like,, four squirts into my water and it’s got lots of flavour. it can serve up to 24 servings too !
they’re relatively cheap and are available at grocery stores, gas stations, anywhere.
stay safe ( or idk do what u want ) 💛 

this only stresses me

* Questo è l’enigma, l’ansia travolgente
di conoscere, il desiderio irresistibile di gettare l’ancora
in te, di possederti.
Come sarebbe la perplessità di essere te,
il mistero, la malattia di essere te e sapere
Come sarebbe lo stupore di essere te, davvero te e
con i tuoi occhi vedermi.
Come sarebbe percepire che ti amo
Come sarebbe, essendo te, sentirmelo dire
E come sarebbe, allora, sentire quello che senti tu.

my mental health is more important than what my body looks like.most people dont care what my body looks like.being happy is more important than being skinny.health comes before vanity. 

Ya girl keeps binging and binging Kms  

Stop post things like “This is only for me.” Or “I’m not pro ana for anyone else but myself.” in the pro recovery tag!!!!You can be pro recovery while having an ED or other illness but if what you’re posting is not recovery oriented do NOT post it in the pro recovery tag. It is harmful to those looking for advice or a helping hand. I do not want to scroll through triggering photos while looking at something that is supposed to be recovery based. Stop pretending that what you’re saying or posting is about recovery because it’s not.  

260 calorie or less pizza1 low-cal tortilla (mine are 100 cals)½ cup tomato sauce (60 cals)¼ cup cheese (mine is 100 cals but you could use low-cal cheese instead)Put it all together and pop it in the oven on around 400 for about five minutes. Or until the cheese starts to bubble. 

A few months ago I on and off was gaining 5 to 10 ponds and over all had went from 153 to 171.I was broken up about it but after passing 170, it was like a wake up call. It was really really hard getting back on track from practically binging for 3 mouths straight to going to 800cals a day tops but I finally did it, I lost the weight and today the scale finally said 153 my lowest weight.I can do it, you can do it to <3 

Similar question answered here.Though, the tricky part here is that you think you don’t have a trusted person to approach. I think it would be best for you to reconsider your options. Here is a list of people that could potentially serve as allies in your fight:ParentsTeachersGuidance counsellors/School psychologistsFriendsMentorsSignificant othersLocal mental centre heads Youth association heads/CounsellorsAnd these are just a few of the options! Even if you feel alone right now, there are people that care about you, and many strangers devote their life to offering to help others as well! If you honestly feel like no one in real life is there (or for some reason, no one can help you right now) you could try looking at some online help options, like what NEDA, online support groups, or ed hope offers just to name a few. Here’s another article about why you might feel alone. 

FUCKI was sending memes to my friend in bulk and accidentally sent her this one AND NOW SHES ASKING WHAT ED MEANS AND I CANT TELL HER CAUSE SHE’LL BE CONCERNED THE IRONY OH MY 

Never judge someone’s eating disorder by the way they look.  

💗 please don’t be mad at your body 💗💗 it’s doing its best 💗 



♡ recovery blog 6th April 2019 ♡
today hasn’t been anything special, but it’s Saturday, and so I must post
I woke up this morning at 7:30am. I got up, weighed myself and such, then got ready to go to the gym with my mum. for breakfast I had some grape-nuts cereal, super duper yum
I went to the gym, came home and showered, had a protein shake and got dressed into this


in the shower, when I looked down, i noticed how much smaller my tummy is now I’m eating healthily and feeding my body well, and it made me really happy
I then went to my nan’s, where I had some fish, sweetcorn and mash for lunch, followed by a double chocolate cookie (yum!) for dessert. it was so tasty, the second cookie I’ve had since recovery started (the first was yesterday)
I then went into town and went shopping. after trying on a few things, I got this outfit


I can’t tell if it’s hideous or amazing, but I love it!
the trousers are see through - it was shocking to me to have something that I could see my thighs in, and that clung to them. a couple of months ago I wouldn’t have even tried it on. but I’m sat in this outfit as of writing this
I then went back to my nan’s, had some egg salad, and now I’m sat here writing this
overall, a good day 

Soooo good😍✨
 









Green thinspo  



Chocolate Protein Fluff with cacao nibs *-*
And Gimli also seems to be interested in my yummy food ^^ 

im going to try to eat 800 calories tomorrowwish me luck✨ 

One of the most difficult habits to get rid of in my recovery is the constant checking of calories. I still catch myself doing it sometimes, and I need to fight against it. It just became something so natural to me, I sometimes do it without even thinking, which sucks.However, yesterday I did something I had never done before: I bought something (those frozen vegan hamburgers) and I didn’t feel the need to look at the package and check the calories. This is such a victory for me because usually I either already know the calories to something (which I’m always trying to forget) or I have almost an irresistible urge to check the package.As soon as I got home, I did what I always do (also, here’s a tip for everyone trying recovery, this helps a lot): I took the burgers out of the package and put them in a bag in the freezer. Then, I threw the package away and guess what? I still have no idea how many calories they have.I tried one today and they’re so good! I didn’t feel guilty at all eating them and, in fact, I’m very happy I decided to buy them. 

i hope everyone in recovery is doing ok and that you remember that youre strong and you can do this! for some in may be easy and for others it may be hard, but each and every one of you can do it. sometimes, baby steps matter the most! 

Eating disorder recovery I teetered back and forth with atypical anorexia nervosa for many years, and fitness and obsessions with clean eating and weight management took over my life quickly.I thought, am I a bad anorexic because I can’t seem to lose? I’ll have to lose more if anyone is going to take me seriously!!!What a shame I felt the severity of my disorder was reflected in my weight, when this couldn’t be farther from the truth Did you know doctors REMOVED an underweight BMI  from being a diagnosing factor in eating disorders? IT IS NO LONGER RELEVANT in medical diagnosis.If a doctor EVER tells you you cannot have an eating disorder because of your weight, get a new one. Xoxo, Lara 😗😙😚😘 

I’m in love with these protein fluffs now (and don’t worry I also had something else for breakfast additionally)🙈

 

Im sorry about you having to move away from your (apparently supportive) best friend. :/ It sucks ass, but im glad you’re trying to keep up contact with her. Don’t let your ed strain your relationship!Do you have any reason to not open up to your parents about your ed?( I wrote up a guide-like thing some time ago to help folks open up about their eds. ) I think that the best way to solve your conflict would be, to just up and tell them about your problems. If you dont feel comfortable with that, explain your reasons why to your friend. From what you’ve told me, she seems like someone who wants the best for you, and im sure she would understand if you told her why you just cant open up right now. You might even ask her to help you with telling your parents, if needed! Also, dont feel guilty. Her telling you to open and to eat, is her trying to help you. Sure, eds are more complicated than that, but you cant expect her to understand that right away. You might find it helpful to send her some articles about how it’s literally programmed into your brain to hate food. This is the gist of it:“

Now a new study in Nature Neuroscience — which Steinglass co-authored — reveals why people with anorexia often struggle so much to integrate new ways of eating into their lives. In the brain, the behaviors associated with anorexia act a lot like habits, those daily decisions we make without thinking. And habits, according to both the scientific evidence and the colloquial wisdom, are phenomenally difficult to break. This new finding helps explain why anorexia has historically been so hard to treat: Anorexic patients are essentially fighting their own brains in an uphill battle for wellness. .

“I hope my answer helped in some way. I am not an expert in any way though, so i advise you to seek out recovery-related resources yourself, and to speak to mental health professionals. 

Body check - really wish I had a scale but I am gonna weight myself soon when I go to the doctor. 

98lbs 5’3 





Showing my face, yeyy🙈 
this is my favorite dog of all time, he’s sadly not mine🙈 

May 17 ‘19
-So im 88 hrs into what i planned to be a 72 hr fast and i somehow feel amazing??? ive never surpassed 72 hrs and have always struggled to make it there so im not sure whats up but im not complaining bitches. This morning i reached my new lowest weight and honestly im going to try and make it to Monday before eating but I’m gonna be home alone all weekend so its gonna be difficult to not give in to temptation, especially bc my mom jusy went shopping and bought hella junk food. Anyways, i hope yall are doing amazing and are staying safe!! If anyone wants to talk maybe be ana/fasting buddies message me and my inbox is always open, id love to meet and talk to more people here!! xoxox ♥️♥️ 

AwareYou know whyWhy you hate your own skin Why you paint your skin redWhy you take the hand full after hand full of pillsWhy you’re slowly pushing everyone awayWhy you cant fall asleepWhy YOU will never know what the taste of happiness is Why you hate your skinWhy when someone points out an insecurity A fatal flaw Why you break apartWhy everyday you want to be less awareWhy you ask “why am i in this skin?”Why you plead “tear it away” 

Today I was looking for recipes for food to meal prep next week and thought, I don’t need it to be low calorie, I need it to be food that sustenta me. And if that isn’t the truest thing ever.Food is goodFood is fuelFood is fuelFood is NOT the enemie, your eating disorder is 

decided to paint my legs so i don’t hate them as much

                no one is going to save you            


What do you choose?
 

I am worth recovery even when I feel totally un-worth it 
So here’s the thing. I’m sad. I don’t know what I want to do with my life, I am currently facing redundancy at work, have little money and I am extremely single and feel like I have nothing to actually recover for… 
But this girl is still not giving up. 
There are far worse places to be in, and even if an eating disorder tells me there is no point to recovery, then maybe my motivation can be to prove those thoughts wrong. 
I guess this is a bit of a sad post, but I wanted to put it out it out there as I admire so many of these amazing beautiful recovery queen’s who are aceing it and in these wonderful relationships with beautiful houses and interesting careers… But I wanted to remind myself that even though I don’t feel like I have those, and am lost in life at the moment… That doesn’t make me any less worthy of recovery. 
Hence eating this cheesecake without feeling motivation, but knowing I need to challenge myself.

My first dinner in this beautiful coconut bowl was mashed broccoli with seeds, nuts and two good sauces🥦🥥 

Any butch/gnc women recovering from eating disorders ??? I need more girls who don’t exactly fit the narrative of trying to be ~beautiful~ in a typically feminine wayTrans/nb women welcome of course 

ice cream is the best thing in the world and i hope y’all allow yourselves to enjoy it all you want because you deserve it 💛🍦 

on that note LMAO does anyone have any go to vegan recipes they can send me?? usually I just eat lots of oats and bowls with random veggies and quinoa. I’m lookin for some other meal ideas please!! :-) 

Fresh faced and *happily* full of pizza 🍕
 

yummy 😊
 

I made the choice. Today was the day of choices for me. I looked back over the past few years and boy was it a challenge. You know, I’ve had to map out my life over the past 4 years simply because I’ve blocked out so much from trauma, Pain, and of course, being so malnourished that I just can’t remember. Heartbreak, tiredness, unhealthy habits, taking care of my mother, the list goes on and on.Have especially been working hard getting up at 3 a.m. everyday to go to work at the hospital as a phlebotomist. I draw blood from the sickest of the sick people. The people dying of Cancer, Parkinson’s, blood diseases, bacterial infections, wounds beyond repair. I do a lot of the dirty work. If I can do the dirty work I’d like to climb a few more rungs up and get into the thick of it. Really really make the impact.  I’m going to graduate real soon with my bachelor’s degree but for some reason I feel like I don’t even have to stop. I know that a lot of people don’t get this chance. A lot of people aren’t able to go on. I made the decision today instead of choosing a master’s degree that I’m going for my medical doctorate. I’ve been talking ever since I was a little girl about inspiring and doing the right thing. I started this blog so that I could do the right thing by myself and spread the love to girls, guys, and other unicorns who need it most during this time of recovery. Yeah, the fact that I’m going to be in debt the scary. The fact that I don’t know where I’m going to come up with the funds. The fact that I don’t know how it’s going to be with me spending a whole extra a year after graduating just to get the prerequisites just to take the test to even be considered for medical school. But I mean, 8 years is going to pass anyway. Why not get some paper on the way?Xoxo, Lara  

Dzień 247Napisałam J. że nie jestem w stanie nic przełknąć.Wyrwał się z rodzinnej imprezy, przyjechał do mnie na 20 minut i poszliśmy do sklepu, znaleźć coś co będę w stanie zjeść. Wiedziałam, że bardzo mu zależy i dzięki temu udało mi się zjeść wafel ryżowy z serem.J : Ana1 : 0 

Recovery Plan I will start by forcing myself to have a net cal intaje of 700 calories a day, which is terrifying. Once 700 is no longer scary and I am comfortable, I will move up to 800 and then continue adjusting to higher calories until Im at 1200 a day. I will not weigh myself at all. I will continue to exercise, but the more I exercise, the more I have to eat. This is terrifying but I know it will be worth it. Also, @daydreamingofdusk really inspired me to recover. Their blog just radiates comfort and reassurance. I reccomend anyone thinking about recovery to take a look and remember whats good for them. Im so happy to be taking steps in a new direction, away from my eating disorder. I know I can do this.

FUCK EATING DISORDERS!!!!!!!
Less than a week into recovery and I have so much more energy!!! I haven’t painted in months and I had the energy to paint two animals in just a day. Yes, recovery is HARD and I look like I’m 20 months pregnant from all the bloating but honestly? It’s worth it. I’m so much happier. Fuck my ed. I hope he chokes on all the bread I’ve been munching on ✌️ 

A reminder 💕 

When ever I’m sad about my body I look at my collarbones and remember the first time I saw them, the first time anyone could see them through my skin. I was so happy and I thought it meant I wasn’t fat anymore. It always makes me feel a little better even though it feels like I have only been gaining and gaining. The little things are the best things 

My birthday is on Monday and I know that I won’t be able to eat cake yet, but I’m sure that next year I Will be able to do it. At least that’s what I’m gonna strive for🌸 

Everytime I decide to recovery for real, I feel all my mental illness’ symptons much more intense, until I give up on recovery and come back to my bad cope mechanisms. Is this a thing or just happens with me? 

in Summer 2017 i was diagnosed with anorexia. i weighed 108 lbs for 5′7″, which was lower than my intial ugw, and i attempted suicide because i still felt too fat. i begged my family for professional help and started seeing a psychiatrist. doctors thought inpatient treatment wouldn’t be beneficial because i seemed motivated, i had just graduated high school with extremely good grades, and i was accepted in a really good school, so being hospitalized would have ruined it.i gained a bit, but not much - refeeding was hard. i stayed underweight for a good while - i was on the waiting list to see a nutritionist. when i started seeing her, she encouraged me to eat as much as i wanted. i started eating 6 small meals a day. i gained weight more rapidly. in September, i was considered physically recovered. my blood results were adequate, and i weighed 123 lbs.but i kept gaining weight, and it worried me a lot. in January 2018, i started seeing a dietician closer to where i lived. turned out i wasn’t eating properly at all. my weight was good, but i was eating too much, and not the right things. it freaked me out a lot, but the dietician gave me a personalized, balanced meal plan, and it helped me a lot. i stopped seeing the other nutritionist. i weighed 132 lbs.in Summer 2018, i was able to donate my blood. it felt good. my blood results were perfect, and i was healthy. i thought i worried less about my body, too. but then i was wrong. i don’t know what happened - i feel like i just looked in the mirror and saw all the weight i had put on appear on my body at once. my psychiatrist put me on anti depressants. they worked good i guess, but they also gave me horrible side effects - including night binging. i gained weight again. i tried restricting again in August. my boyfriend grew increasingly worried. eventually he convinced me to stop.in November, i was diagnosed with adenomyosis and endometriosis. i was devastated. wanting to have children someday was my main reason for recovering, and in the end my uterus was still fucked up, despite all my efforts. i relapsed and stopped my antidepressants brutally in an attempt to control my weight. my blood results were awful. i weighed 138 lbs.i kept having small periods of time where i’d try restricting, but living with parents who were very much aware of my diagnosis made it close to impossible, so the relapses were manageable. my immune system was shit, and i was severely anemic. a bad case of influenza in February made me lose 6 lbs. my dietician assured me that it was a perfect weight for my height, and that instead of focusing on losing weight, i should instead try and restore the muscle mass my anorexia had annihilated. i wasn’t convinced. i weighed around 132 lbs.in April 2019 i relapsed again. my therapist didn’t help, and i couldn’t bare to explain what was going on to my dietician or my parents. i knew they would just try to stop me, and they couldn’t help with what was going on in my head, so it was better to hide it all. i only talked about it with my fiancé, because i trusted him enough. i am still relapsing now. i have lost 6 lbs so far, and i keep lowering my calorie intake - since i still live with my parents, i still restrict at around 1000 calories, which is significantly higher than most anorexics, but - plot twist - is still very dangerous for your health.i am supposed to move in with my fiancé in 3 days, after 4 years of long distance relationship. yesterday evening he texted me this -“i want to live with you so bad, but i’m not so sure it’s a good idea anymore. i don’t know if i’ll be able to care for you. i am terrified that you’ll just kill yourself faster i we have our own place”you don’t know how much this hurts. this hurts more than a binge, or gaining weight. the person i love the most is scared to live with me because of my eating disorder. because of what i do to myself.recovery is really fucking hard, especially when you don’t get proper care. but please, please, please. there is no “i am pro recovery just not in it”. it’s a lie. you know you are sick. please get help. there is no other way out of this. your ugw is a lie. you won’t feel any better. i had reached my ugw. my pictures were being shared as thinspo - the most famous one was me in a pink bra, hands on my hips. i had the tumblr staff delete it for me because it was too painful seeing it passing around on my dash all day. i still attempted suicide because i. did. not. see. a. fucking. difference. you will never feel skinny, or pretty, or worthy of wearing cute clothes and bikinis. never. recovery is the only way and you know it.i know my story doesn’t seem good. it’s not a very good recovery story. hell, i’m posting food logs everyday. i know i’m not doing good. but if i had asked for proper help, if i had been honest with the professionals who were supposed to help me, i wouldn’t be like this now. it would still be hard, but not like that.i am losing the person i love the most because of this disorder. i still feel unable to stop. i don’t know what i’m gonna do and i feel like i am in too deep. but i am still gonna do my best because nobody deserves to be beat by this illness. not even me.you know what’s good for you. please try. 



Something for the way home😊🙈 

Is it considered weird that every day at 9:15am I have to have a cup of cooked peas?  They’re delicious and are full of protein… I just eat them straight out of the cup 🍵🌱 



Feeling almost confident today
5’8 // 106 lbs 

Confessing my ice cream addiction.. 😇
 

Recovery is terrifying (please read)Hey everyone! I haven’t posted in awhile because I’ve sorta been recovering. I’ve been eating whatever I went but I know it’s still under 1,000 calories each day. If I eat even two meals, my stomach hurts so so badly. That’s because your stomach is a muscle and I haven’t used this muscle in ahwile. That’s how eating 100 calories every day for a few months will effect you. This is scary and I don’t know if I’ll stick with it but I’m so happy. I can eat anything! The best part is that I’m maintaining my weight. Please guys, eat more, be free. You can eat more and maintain your weight. It feels so good! 

Sad CorruptedBroken FatUglyStill thinks ppl might love herPathetic 

just found out im gonna be forced to eat lasagna for dinner with my family tonight. its one of my biggest fear foods… but i cant refuse it & i cant purge. im terrified.i was on a 4+ day fast.. but i guess i have to end it at under 2 days. i just gotta work extra hard to make up for this.🌹i will stay on track🌹i cant afford not to  

Me: *looks at food and considers how good eating it would be*My Ed: Me: “I didn’t eat it! I didn’t even touch it!”My Ed:  

In real life, anorexia isn’t pretty. It’s not like in the movies or like the girls drinking green juice on Instagram. 
In real life, anorexia is falling appart and crying on your bathroom floor with vomit in your hair because you lost control and purged…again. 
In real life, anorexia is not being able to laugh, ever, because the disorder doesn’t allow you to have fun anymore and also because your brain is so dry that you don’t understand the jokes. 
In real life, anorexia is having bones so fragile that they can break just by climbing the stairs. 
In real life, anorexia is lying to everybody about your food intake and then losing their trust because eventually they find out. 
In real life, anorexia is having to take so many pills while in recovery ‘cause you can’t poop by yourself anymore (and also having to talk about your poop/digestive system with literally everyone) 
In real life, anorexia is fucking ugly and a total bitch. 

Started off the day with two eggs with cheese (250cals). Eventually I’ll try not counting calories, but I’m already making a stride by eating this many calories so early in the day. The cheese in itself was 110 calories, and when I counted that up, it honestly made me feel really sick. But that’s what I need to fight. So I ate it anyways, and I feel really full right now, but that’s okay. This is just giving me energy for the day, and it tasted really good too. I want to get back to enjoying the food I eat. I’ll do my best at lunch time, and then see what I can do for dinner 🖤 

Tried out flavor drops for the first time now and I still don’t know if I like them or not. I really love the idea but the taste of some of them is pretty artificial and way too sweet. But I like the vanilla ones. Maybe I just need to try other flavors someday🙈
 

I start my dance classes tonight 

Some days you crave salad and do for a long walk in the park. Others you do not work at all and crave cheesecake. Neither days are a waste and should be looked at in a negative way. Life involves eating a wide variety of foods and enjoying a wide range of experiences. Do not let how much you have exercised or how many calories determines the worth or value of your day.  



Yesterday’s challenge: healthy oils🌿
Very very scary but important🙈 



May 12 ‘19
-Just a body check from today! Last night i ate a shit ton of salty crackers and salt alwayyyss makes me retain water so i was pretty bloated today when i woke up BUT i drank hella green tea with ginger bc ginger always helps my bloating go down and i took a shot of ACV with some cayenne and I honestly cant believe how much my tummy flattened back out. In other news, ive been restricting again (abt 800 cals) so im losing again FINALLY, im hoping i can make my gw by summer. Im super hyped too bc I just noticed that my shoulder blades are starting to peek out! Im surprisingly happy today despite my binge last night. I hope you all are doing good today and are staying safe xoxo ♥️ (pics are me) 

Friendly reminderOne day of following your meal plan isn’t going to make you gain 

I’m kinda just realizing how sick I actually was?? 

Where I’ve been Early 2019: Grunge, dark aesthetic, drinking too much, drugs, hardcore relapse, sad, lethargic, jaded, hot headed, not taking care of myself, no check on mental health, brooding. Where I’m trying to be for the rest of 2019: flowy sun dresses, light aesthetic, soft, optimistic, happy thoughts, battling my depression and anxiety and staying strong, slowly recovering from my eating disorder, doing my best for my mental health, being energetic, smiling through it all, letting myself feel for a while and then moving on and pucking myself up.I’m really going to recover and do my best to be positive and confident and all of you are welcome to watch! If you post thinspo or anything triggering, you can still follow me but I wont be following back. If you post recovery things, I will be following back. I am going to bloom and it will be beautiful 

Recovery spell ✨🍎🥐🥑✨I’m casting this spell for recovery onto you all  

You don’t have to starve to lose weight!You can do it 💕 

Anorexia: Why the hell would you eat a donut for breakfast when you could skip and no one would know?
Me: ……Why the hell would I skip breakfast when I could eat TWO donuts and no one would know. 



A lil sunburn and a lil acne but we’re thriving in this beautiful weather 🌼 feeling really good and confident today!   

Thank you all so much! I didn’t even notice I had these many people following me. I hope you are all doing okay. I don’t know what were the reasons that made you follow me. Some of you have been following me since the very beginning of this blog, whereas some of you only started following me when I chose recovery.Either way, I wish you all the best. If you are in recovery, just like me, stay strong, we can overcome this illness and be happy! If you are not, but are considering it, this is your sign to go for it. If I can do it, so can you! I wanted to do something special, because I really feel like I’ve changed quite a lot ever since I created this blog a few months ago (how long has it been? 6 months? Idk, time is meaningless and I don’t keep track of it anyway). So I’ve decided that in the next few days, I’ll be posting some things about recovery: what made me do it, how it is, what to expect, etc. Also, I’m hoping I can answer some of your questions about recovery. I am by no means an expert, but if you have any questions you’d like to ask, go ahead! You can send me a private message or an ask (even anonymously if you want)!

Got a nice box from Dörrwerk yesterday.
Loved their tomato chips and the apple/mango fruit snack so I wanted to try some different products too.
And I was very happy and suprised to recive a gift from Dörrwerk. One of their products I really thought about buying but I didn’t because I didn’t want to spent too much money again🙈 so this made me very happy :)  

A cold weighted object your numbers hold so much poweryou define my worth when i step on I pray the number dont do higheryour numbers are my gospile you are the dearest object i hold you are the knife in my heartyou tell me how much i matterwhen your numbers decrease i know im worth morethen you left meAnguish engulfed me you were the nicotine in my lungsthe chill up my spineyou were my greatest loveyou are a painful memory 

WINNNNNNNN
Guys I bought a tea and a brownie (!!!!!!!!) before councilling today!!!!!
Omg guys. I didn’t eat all of it but I did eat most. I’m pretty sure I’m gaining weight, but it’s okay.  

I usually don’t ever allow myself to have a full snack all at once. For example if I bought myself such a Twix or any other chocolate bar I could only have a small bite every 5 or 10 minutes. Or if I was on my way to my boyfriend I would have one small piece of the snack every train stop.
Can anyone else relate?😅 

im not active every day on this sorry guys!!! i still post a good once a week at the very least though 💗💗also, gUESS WHO HAD A FUCKING SLICE OF PIZZA W MY FRIENDS ON THE WEEKEND!!!!!!!!!!!!I DIDi only had one slice, but it was better than nothing, right? my friend got me a big bit as well, just in case i didn’t have a second (which he was right) but it was still so freeing to go and hang w friends and join in w the fun/foodit may not seem like joining in on eating the same food as them makes an impact, but it actually does. at my best friends party last year, i didnt eat anything and that’s all i really think about from that night. at my birthday dinner, i ate half my salad and didn’t have any of my own cake. with an ed that obsesses over food like this, it WILL take over ur memories of these fun timesso don’t let it do thatdon’t let it take more memories from u than it has 

My friend offered that we make something fancy to match the amazing weather we are having. 
With all the meals out I’ve had recently and the ones coming up…my brain was instantly crying out nope! No thanks. Not for me. 
But I quickly managed to realise how much those were eating disordered thoughts… And agreed to her suggestion of a summer cooking afternoon together. 
I’m so glad I did because I got to try something pretty amazing. STRAWBERRY GAZPACHO. Yes, savoury strawberry soup. Im a rebel, call the police I don’t play by the rules. 
She also baked a gorgeous rye loaf to go with it. Yes she added way more butter to the bread and olive oil to the gazpacho than I was expecting…but it made it taste better. I even asked for extra slices. It made the experience more fun and I truly enjoyed this recipe! So summery and I would definitely make it again! 
 

 

Ahhhhhg… Had a slip, dropped down to 47.4kg. I seriously didn’t think I could possibly lose weight when eating like I do. I haven’t skipped, restricted, purged or exercised (except yoga) but I’ve lost weight… What the hell? If it had worked like this in the first place I would have these problems… Kind of sickly humorous am I right? It’s not even as if it’s only me judging the size of my meals, I have a psychologist and a nurse that’s said my meals are perfect. Yet I’m still losing… Time for more coffee, and thank you so much to all the people who gave me new books to check out! I could kiss you (with consent)😅  

However, I decided to stop counting calories.I hate my body.I want to continue losing weight (and I would like to do it as soon as possible but I will try to go calmly).But I want to try to trust only the diet that was given to me without further restricting it. 

Me, eating food: holy shit I can fit so much of this in me what in the actual fuckI forgot how much a normal amount of food is2 rice cakes? I can eat that whole bitch aND MORE! IN ONE DAY! 

Ahahhahahaha…haha:(( 



Having some healthy snacks on my way to my boyfriend. These are like fruit rolls I used to do some time ago :)  

I’m going to start recovery but I have no idea what I’m doing and could use some advice. So if your trying to recover or have please please please message me with helpful advice or some words of encouragement it would mean a lot.Thank you <3 

Big challenge today: eating out with my family after already eating breakfast and lunch. I usually don’t ever eat lunch and dinner.


Although I couldn’t finish it (because of the snacks I had before and because it was way too much) I am still proud of myself🐝✨
Other, way way bigger challenge was ordering something else than water, I haven’t had any real liquid calories for a long time and it scares me even more than some high calorie foods. 

 

recovery #4
okay, so that’s my breakfast for today. porridge with banana and honey. the thought that it is not the only meal i will have today still seems kind of weird and scary, but i will eat all of it. i hope i can do it. btw here  is a reminder for you to have breakfast and that it’s okay to eat. you deserve recovery💛

Reminder that recovering from Anorexia doesn’t make you fat. Healthy isn’t fat. 

An actual breakfast for once
 

Miss being breakable, fragile, protected by the floor of eggshells made for me by others  

I’m really scared of what happens once I’m weight restoredSo far so much of my ed recovery has been gaining weight.Sometimes I feel like the only reason I eat is bc I know I have to gain weight.But what happens when that’s not necessary?When I still have to wake up every day and make myself breakfast?When I still have to eat? 

It’s crazy to me that this time just last year I was eating maybe a bowl of oatmeal for the day and missing out on so much sleep and now I’m out here eating pop tarts and chicken tenders and living my best goddamn life.  



Today’s morning and night snack🍭🍬 

I’m fuckin trying. So, i’ve been seeing this nutritionist for about a month now.. she did help a little bit when i was trying to recover by trying to get rid of my bad foods ( i now eat half a banana without feeling guilty and i can eat ½ a bagel!!!!) and so  she usually make appointments with me by text. I havent seen or heard from her and its been a month and i’m literally back to zero and my brain is just too much. I also feel like she just.. didnt want to do with me anymore(some might say im overthinking way too much, I know that…my brain doesnt.) Everyone I open up to leaves. and it sucks. 

Started the day with a book and coffee with honey…comfy, cuddly and warm. This sunday rocks 💕 

I’m not going to be posting a recovery record tonight as I’m just not up to it. I feel terrible emotionally, and I’m not even sure why, if I’m honest. It’ll be up tomorrow. Sorry, Millie x 

Hi, I’m Tea.I have anorexia binge/purge subtype. I’m trying to recover, and it’s not an easy thing. I’ve realized that that is not the path I want. I don’t want to hold onto this, and I don’t want this to hold on to me.Anyway, welcome to my fitblr. 

Update Okay so I’m doing well after my break up and gained back the weight I had lost I’m doing well in school And I’m now a MODEL!Im exited cause I missed modeling and now I’m a brand rep! Y’all should go follow my instaBeware_of_the_blaze 

Hey y’all here’s a reason to recover. I went salsa dancing last night. It was amazing and I felt confident, comfortable in my body, and even elegant? Attractive? But just as I was getting into it my vision blacked out and my hearing went dull. Why? Because my metabolism is so low I physically can’t break down stored energy fast enough, or pump blood well enough, or absorb enough oxygen to fuel my body. I want to recover so I can dance.  

“I hope you remember that today is never too late to be brand new.” 
Hey @taylorswift !! Its laur :) I just wanted to share that I have been in recovery from anorexia for a few years now and I am ALMOST 100 days clean of self harm and when I see you on August 14th in Tampa, I will be 124 days clean AND it will be the 6 month anniversary since I was hospitalized for suicide and I’m really feeling so good. I love you so much and thank the stars every single day that I found a love like ours. Thank you so so much.
If you want to say hi and meet me, my seats for tampa are section 114, row n, seats 15-16.
I love you. 
Always. 

Contemplating the weird void I have in my life now that university is over. It’s so difficult not knowing where to go or what to do next in life! 
But it’s ok cause I’m still looking after myself and got a cinnamon cappuccino and chocolate. 


                — 
                Just Facts            


just went out to lunch w my parents. i ordered some butternut squash raviolis w brown butter sage sauce. even tho the raviolis were drenched in a pool of butter i didn’t care! i enjoyed the time w my parents and that matters more than calories. i even ordered dessert ^_^ 



Tea time😄 

Know that the pain will pass. When it passes you will be stronger, happier, and more awareAnonymous 

Me : My Eating Disorder: you look like this  

Recovery: I’m three months into my long road to recovery from anorexia nervosa. I spent 42 days in a residential treatment center after battling with myself for 6 years with my eating disorder. I don’t think it’s important to state the amount of weight I lost before going to treatment because eating disorders aren’t about the weight and food…not really. They’re about the suppressed emotions and finding a new way to “cope”, escape, and find control. I’ve learned a lot through my journey and I barely made a dent in it. Recovery takes about 7-10 years for FULL recovery. I still have bad days. My ED still screams at me. I still think about food and exercise more than I’d like to admit. And sometimes my ED wins during a meal. BUT it’s important to know during recovery there is a difference between a LAPSE and a RELAPSE. A lapse is a bump in the road. It’s when you’re eating a meal and half way through your ED tells you to stop, and after battling with yourself in your mind, the ED wins. BUT you sit with that feeling and understand what made that happen and come back from that. You don’t slip further down the rabbit hole just because you had a slip. Instead you forgive yourself and eat all of your next meal. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss my eating disorder. I’m still waiting for the time when feeling like returning to my eating disorder won’t feel like wanting to go home. But that’s because that’s all I knew. That’s how I expressed my emotions (in a VERY unhealthy way). I was very sick. I’m still sick. But I’m recovering and I choose recovery every day because I now know that life is worth living.  

Reasons to Recover- To be able to move out- To be an exercise class gal- To get fit, like physically healthy fit- To be able to go to the next year of college- To be a living person again- To have real control, not Ana control- To be healthy enough to drive- To live to get doggos  

before you go on and tell yourself how worthless you aregoogle the price of your body on the black market! 

I broke some some ed rules today and didn’t measure my oats, almond milk or the amount of peanut butter 😋 
I always convinced myself that measuring my oats etc. for these jars was just to get the proportions right but honestly, it tastes good no matter what the oat/milk ratio is and the more PB the better 🙈 
Wishing you all a happy Friday and a great weekend! Can’t wait to update you guys after the race tomorrow. I’m having a ton of carbs tonight - pasta, bread and a salad for dinner to get my energy intake up!  

Good morning lovelies 💕
I’m sorry I didn’t post yesterday.
For breakfast this morning I had protein pancakes with banana and strawberries with a drizzle of honey (½ cup of kodiak pancake mix, 5 small strawberries, ½ a banana and 1 tsp of honey).
So I went to the doctors yesterday and he told me that my blood work is all good and my heart is good, so that’s pretty good.
I hope you all have a great day💕 

Hey everyone!I’d like to share with you a really cool youtube channel. I definitely recommend you all to watch her because her videos are usually quite short and easy to watch (which is good for me because my attention span is shorter than of a goldfish). 

This lady is incredibly charismatic (imo) and has helped me a lot when it comes to recovery (including very common issues during/after it, like extreme hunger and guilt after eating).  

i think a mistake many people make when they are recovering from an eating disorder is expecting themselves to recover 100% and never get the voices or bad thoughts or poor body image again. and let me tell you, that is not true. i consider myself mostly recovered from anorexia; however, every day i still get the voices in my head telling me not to eat, to throw it all away. looking at my body is a battle everyday. but i scream back at these awful thoughts. and while most days they are just little whispers, other days they are screaming so loudly that i give in. but i start over again every single day, and i really think that is recovery - the strength to realize that it is hard, but you must continue. 





Made perfect zoodles today and also green asparagus😍 I know I’m having zoodles a lot but that’s kind of my favorite thing right now so why not?🙈
Also im trying to cook with sauces more and more, just to loose the fear of them. But only in baby steps. That’s why I’m starting of with low cal sauces, those make me feel save and I can get used to it again. If that makes any sense😅😅 







Deep orange thinspo  

I just ate three slices of pizza!!!! I know I’ll feel bad later but this is a victory for right now 

I think I might have a serious tea addiction🍵
 

Movie theater VS edI ate over 800 FUCKING CALORIES at the GODDAMN MOVIE THEATER. After literally 3 bites of popcorn my stomach started hurting and the movie hadn’t even started. My bf kept encouraging me and being really sweet saying i can take my time. My stomach adjusted and I tried to eat a little more. And then i let it settle. And then he handed me more and then i just kept FUCKING EATING and not even thinking about it. Between greasy ass popcorn and sugary candy, it added up so quick. And i feel so fucking disgusting. I will admit, it tasted soooo damn good. That was it tho. That’s never happening again. I don’t deserve to eat like that.  

Update and taking a break (TW)So I wound up binging really bad again tonight. I probably wound up having about 4,500 for the day. Most of which was candy and ice cream. I’ve found myself become fixated on dieting and food lately which is causing me to binge. This is the third binge this week. This is not good bye forever but I need some time to step away from social media and refocus myslef on finding a balance bewreen restrictionists and binges.  

reminder to babes with eating disorders on easter: you are allowed to eat something. this time may be hard for you but recovery is glorious and one day of eating some chocolate wont affect your body. 



Yesterday’s lunch was really hard to finish. I usually don’t eat pasta because everything about it scares me and to be honest I don’t even like it that much. I’d rather have some fresh veggies..
But my mom made pasta and there was nothing else there and I decided to try it. It was okay but not in my taste.
I ate about 3000 calories because I need to gain weight even though it is such a bad feeling..  

Okay butAm I the only one who goes through different phases of my own ideal body???

Right now, chicken and turkey is the only meat I eat. really wish I could cut both out of my diet, but grilled chicken is practically the only constant “safe” option on menu’s and plant-protein is a lot more calorically dense than lean chicken. I know some people don’t recommend having restrictions in your diet when in recovery but I honestly think it would give me a shove in the right direction, but I know I’m not comfortable enough with myself yet. Any advice from my veggie/vegan followers who may have struggled with this during recovery? Or am I the only one who’s dumb brain is dumb enough for this lol 

2-26-19I need to talk about how it is 12:30 in the afternoon. I haven’t eaten anything yet today. I packed my food to eat today, but I want to address how ridiculous this disorder is. I am in this fucking lounge feeling myself get dizzy, hearing my stomach growl,  and feel myself growing more and more hungry … yet I am refusing to get up and go to my locker to get the SAFE food I packed today. I am using any excuse in the book to avoid getting up. Excuses like: Your paper needs to be finished before you should be allowed to eat anything.You can’t leave your stuff alone. The coffee maker is still going and you have to wait till its done brewing, It’s 12:45 now. wait till 1:00.I finally went to my locker but the whole walk there and back felt so heavy …as if I was committing a crime. I thought everyone was staring at me. Once I got back to the honors lounge I needed to take a break and sit down because I was exhausted! It’s ridiculous! and these are just minor examples this happens too much for it to be okay. I am in recovery but this voice… this disorder still has a hold of me.  

The truth is, you’ll never feel “sick enough”. Anorexia won’t let you. Don’t wait until you are ready to get help. Eating disorders are dangerous. Even if your BMI is “normal”. Even if you still have your period. Even if you think that you are in control. You deserve help. You deserve happiness. You deserve a life without ED. 

and we back and we back and we back🔮…
here’s a photo of me a few days ago, close to being restored to a “normal” weight. and by normal I mean BMI calculated normal, not necessarily my normal.
my senior year of high school, I developed a lot of stress/anxiety and lost my appetite, eating usually 1 meal a day, sometimes two. I ended up dropping to 113lbs at the lowest point, none of which was intentional. naturally, I gained it back, and by the time a year had passed, gained more than i had ever gained, weighing in at 140. people back home called me fat. “friends” at school said things about my body looking different, and the demands of my career path plus trying to maintain a friends with benefits situation caused me to doubt my entire existence and hate my body. after all, I had been 115 a year earlier and I was beautiful then. what happened?
so I bought a Fitbit. and it all started with “eating clean.” then that accelerated into no rice if it’s now brown rice, not even a bite of halo top, not even roasted vegetables because they had olive oil and oil was bad. everything became dangerous. and 1200 calories was the limit. then came the 10000steps, shortly followed by 15k and a stress fracture. I ignored it and continued exercising. by the time I went home for summer, I was burning 2300 cal every day, walking 16k steps on average and eating only safe foods At 1200cal.
this got worse, and over summer came 40000steps a day, 2 hours at the gym each morning, never sitting, 1200 calories as a cheat day, 400-500 on a normal day, 3000cal burned each day, and occasional binges (obvi from extreme deprivation) followed by 36 hour fasts. I fasted full days 12 times over the course of two months. I developed a heart condition, lost hair, brain function, and confidence. my lowest weight was 103, 13 pounds lighter than my goal weight because nothing seemed to be enough. 
I visited hospitals and faced the fact that I may not return to school. luckily, now that I am back, I’ve been eating on a recovery plan and had most of my fear foods. I’ve realized that exercise is a celebration of what the body can do and not something that is a punishment/requirement, but something I enjoy doing. I don’t have to do hard cardio every day- sometimes I walk the streets and enjoy the world around me because I have found what my form of fitness is. I know I can eat and drink with my friends and it will be okay. it’s not the end of the world if I don’t get 40k steps. 
My friends have shown me perspective- they’ve shown me that having to go 24 hours without food for a medical test was something that seemed strenuous, when I saw it as an easy task. they’ve shown me that my daily 10 mile runs were excessive and showed me that they were proud when they hit 14k steps a day and had 100 minutes of activity on their Fitbit, unlike my daily requirement of 300minutes. they have taught me that it is okay to eat on a day where I don’t exercise.
I don’t know how I didn’t see it before. sure I looked amazing at 105, but that was only achieved by eating 500 calories daily, working out for 3-5 hours a day, walking 40k steps and basically committing a slow suicide. I am happy now. it is hard to accept that I may not be as “beautiful” as I thought, but true beauty is being able to go to drinks with friends, or eat popcorn while watching a movie, and seeing the beauty in the world around me and recognizing that I am a part of what makes this world beautiful. I’m not saying I don’t exercise anymore and eT cookies all day. I love healthy eating because it is delicious and makes me feel good. I love my exercise because of how I feel. I love myself and am the only person to be in this body. and this is my promise to move forward, no matter how tough this road is. 

I’ve lost weight again and a big part of me is so happy about it, but that’s the sick part of me. And I want to be healthy. So I will try to go back to a better weight.  

Reminder to :Eat slow Chew each bite 20 times Drink water in between bites (makes you feel fuller sooner) 

hi it’s mothers day here in aus and i just wanna say if u don’t have a mum or ur mum isn’t supportive or loving then that’s fine and use this day to thank the person who took up their role  

Sunday funday 🌞 

It’s so crazy I constantly have the urge to relapse (cutting) but I just haven’t. I have the means, but I just… don’t? It either means I’m getting better or I’m just getting lazier lol. I’m going to give myself the benefit of the doubt and say I’m improving. Goodnight everyone.  



Are you more into coffee or tea?🌿
I personally drink a lot of tea and I love it. But sometimes I like to have coffee too. But I’ll usually put like 3 vanilla flavor drops from Got7 Nutrition inside my black coffee☕😍 



Another smoothie, this time with 🍌🍊🍍🥥 and 🍎 & porridge 🌻

#TransformationTuesday. On the left, that was me in May of 2016 when I was weighing in the high 90’s. The right is me very recently (so mid-January of 2017), about 15 lbs heavier. In the left photo, I’m miserable. In the right photo, I’m happy to be healthy. So what is better, you ask? Starving yourself so much that you start to crumble away as a human being, or eating whatever you want whenever you want without a second thought? All I can say now is that I’m glad I chose the path to recovery 💪 

You are a slim amd beautiful shadowyou say “starve a little longer”So I dowhen you said “5 more pounds”I agreed when you said “20 more sit-ups”I gritted my teeth and did 25You say “Im fat” with your lovely ribcage showingYou made rulesI follow themyou are my unyielding wardento a prison i can’t leaveYou are a salvationto a heaven i can’t seeyou make me feel warm as you chill my bonesthe smell of freedom and taste of relief are only an index and middle finger awayyou hug me and say “don’t you want to be skinny?”I say “yes”but will i die for this?will i finally be happy becasue of thisor is it just a lovey lie that is streaching too thin?ana is my best friend, till death do us parttill the chill bites our bones and engulfs our lungs 

I am so obsessed with food. I am in complete recovery and it feels amazing but all I ever do is think about eating and look at recipes and browse the produce they have at every grocery store online and it never stops?? I’ve become completely obsessed with veganism and vegan products and while I’m super happy that it’s helping me recover, I’m wondering if this is another new issue? People have noticed and have told me to stop talking about it because it’s annoying. Also I get major anxiety if I don’t plan out my meals at least a day in advance so uhh hehe I’m currently wracking my brain for what I’m going to eat for breakfast tomorrow and weighing my options even though it literally doesn’t matter… wish I could just stop thinking about it all the time bc i have work to do and this is completely getting in the way 

•Pro-Ana is pro death
•If you are giving “Ana tips” on how to starve yourself, you are helping people kill themselves.
•If you run a Pro-Ana account, you are encouraging suicidal and/or deadly behavior.
•If a website deletes your pro-Ana page, stop acting like you don’t know why. They don’t want to be held responsible for the encouragement of self destructive behaviors.
•If you call people “fat” for eating food again, you’re just a villain in someone’s recovery story. 

Eugenia Cooney is finally getting help!!! Im so happy for my queen…

3/25You did all of that hon, don’t be so hard on yourself.  

Anorexia recoveryRecently I’ve reached out for help with recovery and now I have all of these appointments and therapies and people telling me I can’t do it on my own and that I need inpatient treatment. I’m terrified and overwhelmed and my body keeps deteriorating even with increasing my food intake. I would really appreciate some encouraging words or any advice in making it through this 

Still feeling the effects of getting drunkGot lowkey scared cause I was feelin so grossed out by food yesterday that I almost skipped dinner.I didnt count calories but I know I ate less than I was supposed to so there’s that. Today I feel better so I guess I’ll eat normally. 

🌱 If anyone would like to know anything or ask about something, this week is the ultimate time 🌱Literally anything, I’ve been here long enough to know stuff haha. Do not be afraid. I’m a nice human, in a talkative mood. 

daily reminder: its okay to eat something today, no matter how big or small 

UpdateWell I los weightI got cheated on And I’ve gotten the flu twice  

I literally relapsed earlier today and realised that I deserve food so I told the ed voices to shut the fuck up and ate some vegan icecream! 

I haven’t been active on here lately!So, hey to my new followers and my old ones!I love you guys so much, thank you for sticking by me for so long- I don’t know where I’d be without you. Stay strong and keep fighting- you can and will beat this, trust me. 

so I’ve been eating a lot “”“”“”“”“”“junk”“”“”“”“”“” food / “”“”“”“”“unhealthy”“”“”“”“”“ food lately, and my mom who knows about my ed just told me "u can’t just keep eating chips ice cream and cereal! I know u don’t wanna hear it but u need actual food” ! and I know it’s the truth bc my body is probably rotting but Holy Fuck I wanna die :))))))))))))) 

I am moving in the right direction, according to my dietician. After last week’s drama, I am glad. I don’t want to put my life, my goals, everything I’ve worked for on hold. Of course, the silly little voice in the back of my mind is squeaking that the “right” direction is actually the wrong direction. I’m telling that voice to pipe down. Shush, voice. My life’s work is not to be thin. My life’s work is not to have a flat stomach and to be able to feel my bones pushing against my skin. I remember how bad it is in that space, the space I used to occupy when I was trying to occupy as little space as possible. And I refuse to go back. I’m not ceding ground to my eating disorder. I get that my brain is trying to protect me, trying to give me something I can control so that I can handle all the other stress in my life, but I am strong. I don’t need this kind of help, dear brain. I can stand on my own two feet, and I can shoulder this stress without self-destructing. I refuse to give one more day over to my eating disorder. 

The sad thing is She’ll never like me back. 

I’ve been in “recovery” for a little under a month now. The reason why I say “recovery” is because as soon as i’m out, i am going to lose weight again because i hate the feeling of being fat. In this photos, you can tell how much weight I’ve gained and I really really hate. Some positives are, last night I called with my boyfriend literally all night. I love him so much.My horoscope (pisces) for today(November 2nd, 2018):When it comes to romance, your body is apt to turn to jelly today. You may be so emotional that you can’t function, Pisces. That’s love. And even though it can be heavenly, it can also be debilitating. You could deliberate for hours about an issue because you don’t want to make a move without your partner’s input. If you don’t have a romantic partner now, find one soon, but not today.Card of the day: The ChariotKeywords: victory, (material) success, mastery, graduation, completion!Astrological Correspondence: CancerThe Chariot symbolizes enthusiasm, competitiveness, and triumph. Success and victory are achieved by employing all powers at one’s disposal - physical, spiritual, and intellectual. The Chariot symbolizes the positive side of the self, being strong and self-controlled, balancing conflicting emotions, triumphing over obstacles, sustaining an effort, and support attaining goals, thereby leading the way to transformation and self-knowledge. A dictatorial approach, recklessness, and extreme ambition can be on the other, negative side of the equation.-Today’s Tarot Readings-Love: The World The World represents an ending to a cycle of life, a pause in life before the next big cycle beginning with the fool. It is an indicator of a major and inexorable change, of tectonic breadth.Mood: The EmperorThis card is suggestive of stability and security in life. You are on top of things and everything in under your control. It is your hard work, discipline and self control that have bought you this far. It means that you are in charge of your life now setting up your own rules and boundaries.Career: The SunThe card portends good fortune, happiness, joy and harmony. It represents the universe coming together and agreeing with your path and aiding forward movement into something greater. 



this are old but 

it’s been a year since I first developed my ed! thanks I absolutely hate it! 

A small chat about good things & getting better.Before I start I wanna say that I mention calories and body image issues. That being said, I hope it encourages you to celebrate your small victories. Every movement is self improvement.This morning started really bad for me. I felt sick, I missed my boyfriend and I was hating the way I looked. I didn’t want to eat anything but because I felt sick I had a piece of dry toast and a peppermint tea to settle my stomach. When I started to feel better I did some yoga and strength excercises to make up for not running this morning (because of feeling sick and the weather was miserable). After I had finished I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and started to notice things I liked about my body and I forgave myself for being mean to myself earlier this morning. I started dancing to the music I had playing and I found myself smiling. Maybe this feeling won’t last forever and I’m sure I’ll soon return to the way things were. Right now it feels so good to have just a little bit of self acceptance. I ended up having a big glass of water and a banana. In total (including the toast) I had about 150 calories. I normally skip breakfast. This has been a big step for me and I didn’t even expect it to happen. I know that 150 calories is a measly breakfast, but for someone who usually fasts until midday, this feels like a break through. The beginning of something good. I actually looked at my body and LIKED what I saw.I just wanted to share this little victory in case anybody else is having a bad moment. It can and will get better, sometimes when you least expect it. :)Love, Anna. X 

never thought I’d be having a panic attack because of cinnamon buns, but here we are.  

yo, click read more if you wanna read about my new years resolutions and what things i rly want to start working on and what im planning to do, for myself, my helth, and my future! Keep reading 

I don’t even know what ‘normal’ eating is anymore 

First proper day in hospital and like… I can’t exercise…. My rule is I don’t eat unless I exercise and how? Is this? Meant to? Work? 

recovery day seven (1/30/19)really embarrassed at the amount i ate today but oh well. today was okay i was just sad a lot throughout the day. but ill be fine. i made a 97 on my english test so that was good. i have a bad migraine now and i hate myself but that’s fine. i’m really really ready for this extreme hunger thing to go away bc i’m starting to feel super!!!!!! gross :( 

Im trying to recover but anytime I try to eat a normal, healthy amount, I end up eating a BUNCH of really unhealthy stuff, and then I feel really really bad about it. Ah.  

It’s almost the last day of eating disorder awareness week and I just want to remind everyone there is no way to live with an eating disorder- You will die of malnourishment or suicide unless you recover. There’s no exceptions. And everyone who supports “pro-ana” “pro-mia” or “thinspo” is responsible for spreading this disease to others and has blood on their hands. You need to know this 

Panic attacks are horribleEspecially when you wish you had some to talk to… you have nobodyNo friendsFamily wouldn’t get itChat lines for Neda and Kids Helpline are both closed. I am not able to call and talk to them rn but I’d be able to do text-chat but they are offline.Recovery is so fucking hard. Recovering from my ed is super hard but I’m gonna recover. I’m gonna beat this bitch we call Ana (anorexia). She can’t take me. I’m going to win. I’m gonna fucking win. 2018 is the year I recover fully. I know I will have to continually recover and all keep fixing myself. It’s ok. But at least I’ll be able to live my life.

I really want to share this video with you guys. Please listen to her interview about her anorexia. When I watched her talking about her struggles and thoughts I just feel like it was myself telling someone about how I feel.
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨ 

Pizza again 🍕😍❤️ 

HelloSo, i’m changing this acc to a personal/ recovery type blog. my old account was skinnyfragileperfection and it only made my eating disorder worse. so i logged off of there to try and recover. this will be my tumblr for everything from memes to pro recovery posts :3  

felt really really good in my recovery for a hot second, all of a sudden I feel huge and disgusting OBVIOUSLY after a bad day… it’s so obvious that this sickness manifests itself from deeper issues than hating your body. I guess it’s good now that I can recognize that. I will not relapse, not now, not ever. 

focus on life 💞💓💖💖 

Designing myself a tattoo!
 

They always say just say that. Can you not feel how i feel, how can you just eat. its terrifying. That feeling of knowing every bite you take sets you back. But then again what happens when you reach your “goal”. what  will you do.  

♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　Recovery updateOk so recovery is really really hard. Its been almost 6 months of me actually trying to get better. The ups and downs are very scary if I’m being honest. When I feel the old thoughts rushing in it feels almost like I’m stuck in the middle of hell again. I hate how it feels to be helpless in my own body because I know I can.   do it, I know I can keep going but getting to the point of comfortably is very difficult. I know that it’s part of the process to hurt sometimes but most of the times that it hurts I’m alone  and I can cuddle into my girlfriend and vent about how bad it hurts. It’s so difficult and draining just fighting to stay calm when all you want to do is give up. I know I’m strong enough though and no matter how scary or complicated this might be I will keep going until I can’t remember the last time I felt those awful thoughts again.♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥　♡　♥ 

if anyone has tips for coping with an anorexia relapse, please share them with me 

1/30/2019breakfast: half of a whole wheat english muffin with strawberry cream cheese lunch: cauliflower rice with 2 veggie dogs, small bag of popcorn, 3 peanut butter crackerssnacks: 4(?) macaroons, almost half a bag of cheddar caramel popcorn dinner: a chili cheese hotdog (!!!! haven’t had these in so long bc they made me feel disgusting !!!!) and i got a strawberry milkshake! edit: got hungry again and ate lo mein noodles🙂 

I Know You’re Gonna Like This. A Health Fitspo Worthy Glamour Girl. She Is Touching Perfection. Oh Love Her. Blessings. ♡♡♡ 

I know I’ve been fairly inactive over the last year and that’s because I went through….I’m gonna say it.. an eating disorder. I think the hardest thing about having an eating disorder is admitting you have a problem. Not just to yourself, but to your friends and family. Especially the questions. Every time I tell somebody, they say, “but I’ve seen you eat.” Let me make something clear. Anorexia is not not eating, it is restricting severely. It can be done through overexercising, extreme dieting, purging, or any combination of those. Anorexia is difficult to define as a general term to describe anybody, it takes different forms for everybody. So however it manifested for you, your friend or family member, or whoever is in your life, their disease is valid. It’s hard enough to go through recovery without people questioning whether your illness is “real.” So if you’re looking for a sign that you really need to recover, this is it. No matter how much weight you lost, no matter how you restricted or purged, your sickness is real and you deserve to recover. Having a healthy relationship is something everyone deserves to have and as I’m still struggling to find that myself, I can tell you it sounds like something wonderful. If one your friends or a family members has anorexia or any other eating disorder, this is a message to you to be supportive no matter what, no matter how they look.  

elevation requires separation 

Therapy is the hardest thing I’ve ever done–tiring doesn’t even come close, the mental exhaustion is fucking real 

Il sabato di Molly 🙄 

Ugh, when you realize how mentally ill you were in the past after you recover, it sucks. All you can see is lost potential.
And even if you’re overall satisfied with the person you are, this part of your mind’s always like: 
“What if I had been healthy? How much more (insert positive trait here) would I be now? How much better would my life be?” 
And you have to constantly be like: 
“Shut up, mind! This is where we are now, so let’s work with what we got. We can work with this and grow from here.” 

I’m wanting to get better now… I’m tired of feeling like shit and treating myself as such! I want to beat my eating disorder and anxiety. Is there anyone out there that can help?? 

So i came out to my parents and a bunch of stuff has been happening and a lot of the stress i was under is gone so i think im gonna try and move past this as well if i can. I wanna leave all the negativity i can in 2017 and really start fresh in 2018. I think that starts with moving past this.  

yall i have a meeting w the head psychiatrist of eds tomorrow and i want death bc hes the biggest fuckwit ive ever met and legit no one ive met @ eds has liked him 

Today my friend had the best response when I told her I felt like a failure for giving into my ED again.She was like “Don’t, it’s NOT your fault. This is just a little hiccup and it doesn’t make you a failure.”And she is right. It doesn’t make me a failure. I am sick. I have a disorder. And I was strong enough to recognize things were getting out of hand and had the courage to DO SOMETHING about it. I don’t want to let this eating disorder rule my life. I don’t want to give up the things I love just to be “thin” or whatever my ED wants me to be. I don’t want to hate myself over a bowl of oatmeal or a less-than-perfect grade. I don’t want to feel exhausted and overwhelmed. I want to be happy & healthy. I am saying this from one of the darker places I have ever been at. This is how I know I am going to beat this disorder. Even though my disorder is SO. LOUD. I am fighting to make my voice heard. And that is so far from being a failure. It makes me strong and resilient. Even if I am crying over oatmeal.

                you can change things darling             


My eating disorderBefore I ever used drugs, I starved myself (ages 13-16). I had a different blog and closely followed the “pro ana” and “pro mia” communities (anorexia and bulimia). My cellphone background was a picture of Dr. Phil pointing at me, and it was labeled you’re fat. Don’t sugarcoat it, because you’ll eat that too. I followed a diet created by anorexics called the ABC diet: one day you eat 200 calories, the next day 300, maybe fast the following day, and eat 500 calories max on the fourth day. I was addicted to hearing my stomach growl and seeing the number on the scale plummet.When I started using drugs at the late age of 16, my eating disorder seemed to vanish. I still hated my body, but being able to control how I felt with substances shifted the direction of my addiction. I loathed what I saw in the mirror, but that didn’t really matter anymore because I was too high to care. At this time I also taught myself how to vomit on cue–if I overrate I would run straight to the toilet.Now that I’m clean I am throwing up a lot more, but not enough to raise concern. I know I have a problem, but the problem isn’t out of control and it isn’t too enormous. I probably throw up three times a week, and sometimes not at all. But my ED tendencies are still there and I’m afraid to confront it and tell anybody about it. I have no shame speaking about my heroin addiction, but when it comes to food I feel a little embarrassed.I wanted to write about this because I need to be honest with myself, and you guys. I don’t want anyone to think that my addiction has vanished, and that sobriety is “easy” for me – I’m still an addict, and my toxic behaviors are still present. I’m afraid that if I stop puking, I’ll just do something else to harm myself.

i cannot tell you to fix yourself or to stop whatever kind of self-destruction you’re doing, that would make me a hypocrite and if i can’t practice what i preach then that’s just not fair, but please don’t push yourself too far.  if you’re getting really light headed from malnutrition, at least eat a couple of snacks, something that can sustain you.  it’s not fair to let your body completely break down just in order to fit what you feel is the beauty standard, and i wish the pressure to lose weight was never reinstated in people, it fuckimg sucks.  im saying this because somebody dm’d me and told me to delete this account because it “glorifies mental illness and eating disorders” and it absolutely does not.  i do not try to make eating disorders seem cute or whatever the fuck, they’re painful, physically and mentally.  sometimes i can’t move because my stomach hurts so much from binging or from laxatives or from gastritis because i have been so destructive to my body, nothing about that is pretty.  i’d say that 80% of people with accounts like mine have them because it’s a release that they can’t have irl, it’s hard to talk about eating disorders with people who don’t understand, and on this website we can all understand each other.  but i understand that some things i post can be triggering and if you see something of mine that makes your eating disorder worse, please block me, i wont be offended.  i love all of you and hope that you’re able to be healthy and happy.  i know you can do it. 

So I’ve lost 23 pounds in 3 months but I’m unhappy. I’m still all flabby I’m not muscular. I never wanted to be just skin in bones. I want like a nice flat stomach with muscular thighs butt and arms. So I think I’m done restricting. I think I’m going to get a nutritionist and start doing this right.  

Le cose non stanno andando bene per niente…io ce la sto mettendo tutta..forse non abbastanza per gli altri ma non si guarisce dall anoressia o altri disturbi alimentari in un giorno..non capiscono quanto sia difficile smettere di soffrire ogni volta che si mangia,smettere di odiarsi in questo modo quando tutto attorno a te ti fa male e la malattia sembra essere l unica cosa che hai 

i was at a party and my friend told me i looked a lot skinnier and more fit my brain: yes how nice u deserved that compliment you have been working harded brain: imagine what she would have said had you not binged 4 days ago fatty  

When I look at my arms: ewww gain some weight.
When I Iook at the scale: hmmm maybe next time. 

I’m feeling weirdly introspective and thinking. So like I had a realization I’ve never imagined myself having last weekend. I was creeping on the Instagram of this girl I just met through one of my old friends. (She’s garbage by the way. The new one) She has one of those bodies that are like tiny and sucked together and has no ounces of fat on it. And she’s friends with these (equally awful and probably even more so) girls who are basically tanner versions of her with these like stick legs and tight stomachs that probably are only ever fed celery and vodka. And I was like “I would take the extra meat I’ve gained in recovering from my eating disorder than be that tiny and sticklike and boring.” And it blew my mind that I felt like that. I’ve never been this positive about my body before. It’s like I’ve hit a new level. Anyone who is still in the grips of their eating disorder or myself a few years ago, all would die inside reading this and say I’d been brainwashed over to the healthy, fat side of life. And you know maybe I have. But even if that’s the case the awesome part is I give no fricks. I don’t want to default to whatever it is that keeps me skinniest in life and not make my own choices. Not to say I don’t eat really healthy. I do. But if I want a friggin butter croissant from Starbucks like I did this morning, I’m gonna get one damn it. And it’s awesome. And I hope all the girls and dudes out there struggling with eating disorders find this kind of peace one day because I never thought it was possible but it is. 

Guys omFG IM SO HAPPY I GOT MY PERIOD BACK! (i didnt had it for like 7 months bc anorexia and now its back) 

last night my bf and i went to this adorable little ramen shop for dinner. i didn’t listen to ed at all, got exactly what i wanted (we also ordered 2 bao which are buns with pickled veg and pork), ate as much as i wanted, and felt so happy. what really helped was being mindful the whole tine – focusing on solidifying this fun memory in my mind, paying attention to lighting, smells, sounds, tastes, and the company/conversation :-) 
afterwards we went to the cupcake shop down the street and got some dessert to bring home! ?? ! and i was just ?? in awe of how easy this whole eating this is, like, yesterday was probably the first time in who knows how long that i’ve eaten normal amounts intuitively. i’ll be honest, it’s not “recovery” amounts or anything, esp considering i worked a crazy exhausting shift, but it’s a start, and my headspace is really good atm.
now this morning i’m starting another busy day off with a berry muffin, cereal, a banana, and coffee. s/o to breakfast for helping me thru these long days at work!! 

Whether it’s starting recovery, increasing intake, trying a fear food, or giving up food rituals, compulsive exercise, body-checking, bingeing, purging, or whatever your ED tells you to do. Because that moment will never come. Do you really expect your ED to say ‘yes’? To give you the green light? Would you expect a jailer to set his prisoner free?The only way to be free is to break out of the cage. The only person who can free you is you. Quit waiting. Just do it. The time is NOW.  

i honestly feel terrible hahaso after my visit to the doctor i just found out i managed to lose 1kg after a week of pretty bad eating and attempted restriction, a n d apparently i’m 5’7 now which is pretty cool i guess. a bit disappointed since i could’ve of done much better but it isn’t bad considering how busy and overall chaotic this week was thanks to the multiple doctor appointments. can’t wait to get today over with too so i can finally stop pretending to be healthy and restrict again, i always think i’ll feel okay when i eat normally but really that thought lasts for like, three minutes into it and after that i’m so uncomfortable and mad with everything. this week was utter hell, i feel so fat, i’m mad because i prolly slowed down my progress with the normal eating and i highkey want to die now lol but what’s new ahaha :”)  

Y’all I need help!!
This is what I’m wearing to my upcoming school dance
The wig looks more purple in real life but the colours are fairly similar. However the theme is “masquerade”. I want to make a mask like this:
But I don’t want that to be pink too. So I need y’all to vote for me. Do I make the mask with pastel blue and cream flowers and just a couple of dark blue ones. Or do I make it just white and cream? Helpppppp 

Today is the first time I’ve been left to eat on my own since before being admitted to hospital and I’m having ice cream and black coffee for lunch

                memoirs from a relapse pt2.             


nobody around me understands what recovery really looks like. it’s fucking night sweats, acid reflux, abdominal cramps so hard that leaves you breathless, it’s worrying about not eating enough while the voice inside your brain prevents you from keeping feeding yourself, it’s crying on the top of your meal because you lost your appetite but you have to eat to not die, it’s fucking diarrhea and it’s fucking constipation, it’s looking at your stomach crying because you feel like a fucking balloon, it’s trying your best to not vomit when you’re terribly nauseous because you have seen too much vomit when you had an ed. but it’s worth it. every single thing of it will be worth it because i’m feeling like crap in order to feel ok again, while having an ed is feeling like crap in order to feel even more like crap.

So I walked out of my therapy appointment yesterday and I was in such a dark place an I saw this jogger. I looked at her and I started making assumptions. I thought, “she’s so _____ she must have an ED.” “She’s more ____ than me.” “How come she gets to _____ and I don’t?” And on and on. I’m not proud of these thoughts.
But then, she caught me staring, and she gave me the most genuine smile I think I’ve ever seen. It was so full of life. Her eyes were bright, caring, and so happy. It wasn’t that nothing was wrong in her life, but that she could tackle the world with her strength. I could tell she was running because she loves running. Because she has the energy to run. Because it’s her self-care. Because she fuels her body with food, not lies in her head and disordered thoughts.
My new goal in life is to achieve that smile. No grade can give me that, no material item. Everytime ED yells at me since I’ve seen her smile in my mind. I’ve found a new reason to recover. 

one of the worst things about anorexia, bulimia, EDNOS, BED…any of the eating disorders one can develop, is the loneliness.your relationships crumble around you. your boyfriend tries to understand, but you know he doesn’t really grasp the gravity of it.it doesnt matter how many times he will tell you that you’re beautifulor smartor funnyor deserving of life(deserving of him)because it will not make you feel any better.if anything, you feel worse.you want him to know that you aren’t doing this to be irritating, to be vain, or because you genuinely want to break his heart.you’re doing this becauseyou can’t help it anymore.and you don’t know how to help yourself let him know that he’s the only thing pulling you back from the brink of self-destruction. 

Three nice things about my body!1.)  My tummy is soft and good for cuddling.2.) I have a very youthful face3.) I have an average foot so it’s easy to find fashionable shoes 

Starving myself will not:
Decrease the sadness I feel over missing my family.
Remedy the fact that I've shoved my dear friend away.
Cause others to love me more or to care about me.
Prove to others how much I suffer.
Change my decision to live here.
Cause me to miss my job less.
Right my wrongs or the wrongs of others.
Change the past.
Improve my future. 
 

Being in recovery is hard, especially following an eating disorder, I have to fight the voice in my head everyday to eat food, especially breakfast, for me it was always the easiest to skip.
Tumblr is my amazing motivation, the first thing I do in the morning is go on and look as food until my stomach is grumbling so much I’m prepared to go out in this cold 

🕊 

Went on a date tonight. I found it pretty uncomfortable because my date was being awkward. Later, texting, he said he felt like I was trying to run away and didn’t want to be there. I thought I was doing really well. I am just so bad at this!

Eating Disorder Confession #3I became vegetarian just so I could limit more of what I eat and means people won’t ask questions when I don’t eat certain things 

Siamo già al 28 maggio? Dio… Ieri in Accademia ho chiesto ad una ragazza se fosse il 24, e sono rimasta sconvolta nello scoprire che non era così.
Sono stanchissima, davvero stanchissima, e non so nemmeno bene spiegare perché. Sì okay, ho fatto cose, sono stata su e giù fra Lucca e Firenze… ma non credo di poter giustificare una stanchezza così. Forse tutto sommato è anche una stanchezza “emotiva”, dato che mi sento purtroppo anche molto vuota e con un senso di tristezza al quale non so attribuire un motivo specifico.
Depressione, la chiamano. Ed io penso che personificarla nella figura di un Dissennatore sia davvero un paragone perfetto. Non a caso c’è chi dice che la Rowling avesse immaginato i Dissennatori proprio come riflesso della sua, di depressione.
Stamattina sono stata dalla psicologa prima e dalla dietista poi. Dalla psicologa stavolta ho raccontato tanto, eventi passati che ancora non le avevo chiarito bene ma che già sapevo (dalle terapie effettuate in passato) che hanno grande impatto sul mio presente. Non è ce sia stato un incontro pesante, dato che sono fatti che già ho ripetuto molte volte… ma prevedo colloqui difficili nel prossimo futuro.
Dalla dietista è andata nì… nel senso che abbiamo preso il peso, stavolta accertandomi di essere nelle condizioni più “favorevoli” al prendere il mio peso più correttamente possibile… e non è che il riscontro sia stato così positivo. Da quando ho iniziato ad avere crolli emotivi maggiori il mio peso è sceso nuovamente un po’, in seguito ad un periodo di “stasi” pseudoconcordata (nel senso che la mia dietista vorrebbe che io ricominciassi a salire, ma ha accettato il fatto che in questo momento io non sia pronta). Il patto però era che io comunque non scendessi, ma sono sincera nel dire che non lo ho fatto apposta. Cercherò di stare più attenta, ma non è affatto facile…
Comunque forse qualcuno si starà chiedendo come sia andato lo scorso fine settimana, che tanto temevo, e come mai io ieri abbia scritto che non avrei pubblicato il diario perché stavo male.

Leg check sos  

It’s been 6 weeks into recovery and I have gone worse. I lost weight and now am probably going to get an admission into hospital :( i should’ve tried harder. 

27/05/19I’m putting weight on and I’m scared. I can see the fat, I can feel the fat,It feels slimey and clings to my bones. The scale going up is proof of my fears, but I can’t stop. I’m not even hungry and yet I eat. I’m so scared 🥀 

Today Sucked!!!but i’m still going to eat something, and i’m still going to wash my face and have some nice oatmeal tomorrow morningwe will try again tomorrow. and if tomorrow isn’t better, we will keep trying 💘🍓🤟 

29/05/19 update #1I’m getting to my GW and I’m super excited about it. I hope everything will continue to go fine and I won’t gain. I’m a little bit nervous, because my dad is coming home from work tommorow (he works abroad for a few weeks and then comes back for one or two) and I’m scared he’ll pressure me to eat more or will make comments about my eating or weight. I can only hope everything will be good. I’ll maybe just hide my body in bigger clothing and hopefully he or anyone else won’t notice my weight loss. Wish me luck.  

How my day is going…I skipped 2nd block to get high in the bathroom because weed is one of the only things that makes me feel better. I feel really lightheaded but I’m planning on staying under 100 calories today.  

This was me… two years ago.  

so i decided to keep away from tumblr for a few weeks prior to my 18th birthday. mainly because i was beginning to be in a relatively good headspace and wanted to maintain that for my b-day. i was doing okay, i restricted myself to only eating 300-500 calories a day (although, i did mess up on a few days) and then my birthday came around and i live in the UK, so i was able to go out and drink. and i got so drunk, i think i drank my weight in alcohol. AND, on top of all of that, at the end of the night, me and my friends got a massive take away and i ate nearly fucking all of it. i was looking back on photos of me on my birthday night out and i’ve just been sobbing, i look so disgusting and fat. i’ve decided to come back. i needed to come back. please please PLEAASSE, if you have anything, sweetspo, meanspo idgaf, just help me find the motivation to fix the mess i’ve let myself become. 

I hate this disorder For the past three days I have stayed at 200 cal and I have lost weight I didn’t think I would and I have been doing ok to but then of course I binged on a 900+ cal breakfast this morning so I guess all my progress is gone now. I fucking hate this disease, I never used to be like this before. Recover people, because this shit is awful

A few more casual ana phone wallpapers for those who asked.  

I’d say my first 20 hr fast is going quite well
 

Safe Space Account  If you see anything saying “reblog if it’s okay to send you *blank*” or something like so do know I reposted it because it is wather it’s mean spo for me or a release for you I’m a safe space account #safe space account should be spread and use to let others know your there if you need them and they can talk to you 

Some news no one will care about RANTSo I recently told my friends about my eating disorder and I’m happy about it but at the same time I regret it.Like they are trying to help me recover and I would love if I did but at the same time I don’t want to. Something in my mind wants to stay sick and I don’t know why. My friends will ask me how I’m doing when we are alone and I don’t want to disappoint them for falling back into my illness because I’m really trying to do better. But like when they ask if I have had breakfast when I didn’t I’ll still tell them I did or when I’m don’t have a lunch with me I’ll just tell them I’ll eat at home after school and I feel bad for lying to them but it is so hard to just stop with my habits.Like I told my friend I recently tried throwing up again and she was so disappointed (or at least it looked like it) and she said she didn’t know how to help me, while she was so proud of me when I told her that I was eating and actually enjoying some of my meals last break. So I have no idea what to do, like I want them to be proud of me and I want to get better. But at the same time I don’t, I want to get tiny and I don’t want my illness to leave me, what might sound really weird but yeah..I have no idea what any of you need to do with this information but I felt like ranting for a bit so yeah.  

having body fat is human and shouldn’t be something to be ashamed of or insecure about ❤️ 

Breakfast: nothing-(0)Lunch: 1 package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/6 cup tomato sauce-(20)Dinner: 1 package seaweed snacks-(30), ½ package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/3 flavoring packet-(5)Total Intake: 95 caloriesToday was a really shitty day and I feel like a whale. I was going to go for a walk but I threw up and still feel sick so I’m just going to do some light exercise at home.   

I fucked up today. Won’t post any details or triggers, I don’t want that for my blog. I’m just in a hard place right now and will do my best to keep up the motivation to keep fighting… Have a wonderful day/night everyone!  

Like this if you are in recovery from an eating disorder/self harm and I will check out your blog. 
I need to follow some blogs that have weight restored and are moving forward in recovery as motivation that I can keep moving forward as well. 
Also, if anyone is in recovery from an eating disorder, and since recovering have gotten a job/got into university, I would really appreciate if you could comment on this if I can ask you about that transition? 

This is probably to scandalous for here… but fuck it. 
I feel so fucking fat and I’ve lost a lot of weight but my stomach is still as repulsive as ever. You can’t really tell in this picture but I have pudge like crazy. I don’t understand how the scale says what it says but I still feel so fat. I weigh less than I did in 8th grade. I shouldn’t feel like this. I need help. I need to start eating healthier and working out too, maybe that will make me feel better. 

I just want to say something… recovery from your eating disorder will not make you fat. I know it is hard to just believe that but it is true. When I was in the darkest times of my disorder, at my lowest weight and dying, I thought I was fat, but it is only now that I am recovering that I see I never was. My body was sick and thin and bones and it was not beautiful. My disorder made me ugly when I was so beautiful to begin with. So here I am, recovering and beautiful. My body is still skinny, I have no turned into some whale in the course of a few months and I will not, my body has settled at my size I am now and it is beautiful. So if you are scared to recovering because you think you will get fat, then you are wrong. You deserved to feel beautiful.

                Your body wants to be healthy. At a healthy weight, at a healthy place in general. It craves natural health and natural weight. Even when you have ED urges, there is the subliminal, underlying most basic urges of your body - the urges for food and sustenance that helped us survive when we were cavemen and that are the reason we exist today. We are built to survive, so our bodies ultimately know what’s best for us, not our brains. Try to listen to your body more than you listen to your brain at this point because your brain can be taken over by ED but your body remains uncorrupted. Your ED thoughts don’t know anything compared to the thoughts that helped us exist eons ago. If your body wants pizza, give it pizza. If it wants salad, give it salad. If it wants 10 desserts or a steak, give it everything it wants and needs. It knows what it’s doing. {taken from a pep talk I gave lucy-lifting x}            


BE LET THIS BECOME TRUE 

i havent weighed myself in over 3 years, and it doesnt bother me anymore. i dont let a number dictate my happiness 

So I went to the dietician yesterday and got put on a meal plan. Today was my first day on the meal plan and I didn’t fuck it up. I panicked and felt uncomfortable, but I did manage to do it. :)

                me everyday            


I am so sick of my body image, it’s so bad. And I am really, literally sick. I hate having to fight this eating disorder and I hate how screwed up everything is- my hunger signals, body image, metabolism, my health and happiness are compromised every day, extreme anxiety… It sucks. 

Never ever again am I going to let my ED convince me that I don’t like a certain food, because it doesn’t want me to eat it, because it’s ‘unhealthy’. There are so many beautiful, wonderful, tasty things I’ve been missing out on for far too long. The amount of times I catch myself saying 'No thank you, I don’t like it’, and I have to ask myself do I really? Or is that something I’ve taught myself to say, as an excuse not to eat it? 

GOING TO SEE MY PSYCHIATRIST @ THE HOSPITAL FOR THE LAST TIME TOMORROW I’m so hyped  

Just spontaneously had yogurt with raspberries and honey cuz you know what FUCK YOU ED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

So in the few days I’ve been using tumblr, SO many amazing people have reached out to me and are so caring and wonderful. I can’t believe how nice people are here and I’m so grateful for  the support!!! 😊☺️ 

one of my best friends whatsapped me before to tell me i had a lovely figure and i was like “babe i have literally gained 15lbs since february” and she was like “NO WAY WHAT YOU CANT TELL" 
this makes me happy
i can tell
you guys can probably all tell
but people with entirely rational thoughts towards size CAN NOT
magical 

Today I had pizza and ice cream for dinner. 
This time last year that would not have even been a thought.
 I would have panicked. 
Today, I’m the one that suggested it. 
Recovery is possible, I promise 

so i went shopping today! to replace some clothes that are all extra small in size not because they don’t fit me anymore but because they can trigger me and quite honestly i’m tired of getting triggered by the clothes i wear being scared like shit maybe i won’t fit into it anymore. DONT DONT DONT work your body to fit your clothes get clothes to make you happy yes some of the above are still xs but hey its a start I’m happy and I feel confident in these which is fucking fabulous! Have a great day all you recovery kittens ! <3  

I guess you could say I am doing pretty well in recovery. I am able to get in most of my meal plan most days, I’m finally allowed to exercise again and my body image isn’t good but I can deal. 
I’m also beginning to recognize how sick I was. Even though I often fall into the trap of thinking that I wasn’t “that sick” or “that thin” I have to keep reminding myself that I was, and that I was dying. I think some of my denial is my teenaged invincibility where I think that it could never happen to me, and some of it is just how sick I was. 
Before res, my blood pressure was in the toilet, I fainted so much that it was no longer an emergency, just an inconvenience, I was losing my hair, and my ass was so concave and bony that I bruised my tailbone from sitting on the hard chairs at school. Sure, my legs were so thin that I could wrap my hands around the top of my thighs and have my fingers touch, but they were basically useless because I could barely make it up the stairs without having chest pains and heart palpitations. 
Now, I’m trying to deal with how weak I made myself. My bones are brittle because my body had to break them down for nutrients when it was starving, my heart is still to fast (it used to be too slow) because it is atrophied and working hard to pump enough blood, and I struggle to get through a single exercise class. But I’m getting better. Stairs are no longer an obstacle, they are a part of life, and my hair has finally stopped clogging the drain. I don’t like to look at my legs, but I can accept that they are the way they are and that they have to be this way for me to survive. 
This morning, my friend offered to pick up coffee for me. I didn’t have time to look at the nutrition facts, so I just asked for what I wanted, which was caramel iced coffee with skim milk and splenda. I may not finish it, hell, I may only take a few sips, but a few months ago, the idea of even letting somebody think that I would drink a 200 calorie beverage was just impossible.  

Hi everyone! I haven’t posted anything in regards to how recovery has been going lately so I wanted to catch you all up to speed. 
I am eating like a person without an eating disorder and it feels incredible. I never thought I would be able to say that. I’m not afraid of food all day everyday and my eating disorder’s voice is soo weak now. I can crush Ana instead of Ana crushing me and I actually love myself. It is THE most bizarre, amazing sensation in the entire world and I never thought I would get here. 
I told so many therapists and doctors that self love was impossible for me, and I believed it was impossible. But I’m here, well above what my eating disorder would consider an “acceptable” weight and I love my body, and I love myself. 
DO NOT GIVE UP ON RECOVERY!!!!! 
If I could do it, I KNOW you can too. 

eating is sucky sucky sucky again, it’s not like I’m not eating ALTOGETHER, I’m just hella uninterested in it ? :/ 

My dad is a single father of four children and although i’m the oldest, I was the last to live with him. In fact, I just started living here last September. Despite having two very young siblings, I still eat the least amount of food in the house, yet for some reason i’m the only one that gets penalized whenever I do eat. When I first moved in, I was filled with empty promises. I was told I could help myself to whatever I wanted and to make myself at home, so at first, I did. We didn’t have much, but we had a lot of pasta in our pantry, tuna for the kids lunches, and perogies. So, when I came home for lunch those would be the things i’d make myself to eat, because we certainly didn’t have anything else suitable for me to have for lunch. I’d use these foods often, and every time around dinner my dad would get mad at me for “using up all the dinner food and not leaving enough for anyone else” so I assured him I just wouldn’t have any of that item for dinner, and since I hardly ate dinner anyways, I began to make an effort not to use up too much food that someone else might be able to have. Remember: I have a 10 and 8 year old sibling and I am constantly the one with the least amount of food on my plate already. There’s one night that I will never forget. My dad had never screamed at me so loudly; had never been so angry with me. I had made myself pasta for lunch that week, not realizing we didn’t have any more down stairs, and when my father went to put pasta into the boiling water, he was furious to find out there was none. I was sitting with my brother in my bedroom, talking and having a good time, when my father charged into my room and screamed and screamed at me for all the pasta I had been eating and consequently using it all up. He slammed my door so hard my mirror fell off, and I couldn’t even cry: tears just started streaming down my face. I didn’t understand, I hardly ever ate. How could he be so mad at me? Did I not deserve to eat like the others? Did I really eat too much? I can’t stop thinking about this, and now every time I make myself food I have to mentally prepare myself to get yelled at again - more often than not it’s just easier not to eat at all.  

I seriously can’t believe it… I’m so happy, this made my day… I appreciate the fact I have it like never before… 

I deserve to eat. I deserve to eat. I deserve to eat. I deserve to eat. I deserve to eat. I deserve to eat.

100% back on my meal plan after a two-day lapse :)Breakfast: oatmeal w/ ff milk + dried cranberries, scrambled eggs, toast w/ cream cheese, orangeLunch: mexican chicken & rice bowl, latte w/ ff milkSnack: 70g chocolate barSnack: EnsureDinner: salad (lettuce, bell pepper, tomato, cheese, sunflower seeds), grilled chicken breast & russet potatoesSnack: 5 tea biscuits w/ PB 

I’ve just achieved what is possibly the biggest success of my recovery so far! I went to visit my Nan for the day, because I haven’t been to hers since Christmas, and haven’t seen her in weeks. We just spent the whole day chatting and knitting and reading and watching crappy quiz shows on tv and shouting the right (and also often wrong..) answers at the screen and it was lovely.
Anyway, for dinner she told me she was cooking my childhood favourite, her special Macaroni Cheese. I used to ask for it every single week growing up, pre-ed it was my absolute favourite food of all time. She makes it with an ENTIRE TUB of Philadelphia and a WHOLE BLOCK of mature cheddar, so understandably the ED voices were very very loud. But you know what? Why on earth shouldn’t I be allowed my favourite food? Why should I have to lose a cherished part of my childhood? Why should I deny myself perfectly normal things, that make me happy? No fucking reason at all, that’s why.
So I took the kind of portion I would have taken pre-ed (Nan let me serve myself rather than doing it for me because, surprisingly, she understands my negative thoughts better than any of the rest of my family) and I enjoyed every single bite. So fuck you ED, you tried to kill me again yesterday, but you failed again, you’ll always fail. I’m taking my life back from you, and I’m fucking winning.  

Guess who went a whole day without weighing anything or counting calories!? Me! This girl right here! I also went out for ice cream with my family tonight! I may have gotten a kiddy cone, but its a start! I am in such a good mood! I hope this lasts and I don’t over think it later 

I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT UNI AND I HAVE TO DECIDE BY MONDAY. HELP.  

tfw u see thinspo posts when you’re trying really hard not to worry about food during the holidays and then u feel really shaky and anxious and sick 

Just got back from my doctors, as most of you know I was declared weight restored december last year and allowed to start rowing again. i do high physical activity 7 days a week, and due to my anorexia eat predominantly clean and sporadically.
i’m eating ~2000 calories a day. I thought at a ‘healthy’ weight you were supposed to stop gaining. I’ve been lifting a lot of weights, but i gained a lot just in the past three months.
i am at my highest weight in 3 years. and I’m so scared and terrified and feel disgusting. i feel fat and horrible and gross. 
i feel despicable.
i hate me. 

I hate when people glamorize eating disorders or make light of them as if the “diet” they’re trying out can be compared to anorexia or binge/purge habits like no, you having a salad before your burger and fries is a healthy choice so is being able to even eat it. I nearly died from mine, my kidneys were shutting down and even with all that knowledge and being underweight and straining my heart I still battle to follow my meal plan and the first week of treatment I cried through every single meal and snack they tried to feed me. Bawled like a baby, I hated myself for eating anything and soon my safe foods weren’t safe either and I lost my friends, I lost my dignity, i lost myself and my disorder is nothing like a fucking diet or something to aspire too. Having to have my meals supervised even out of treatment is embarrassing. My anorexia is not a joke or a diet and I dont understand why anyone would aspire to be this way. 

I feel like is not worth it 
I feel like shit start starving again
Then I feel like shit for not getting better
And starve myself as punishment 
I’m just 
So overwhelmed by emotions I miss my  apathy 

yesterday my therapist put an empty chair in front of me and made me imagine that my eating disorder, which she called ed, was sitting there and she made me talk with him and it was honestly the craziest, scariest and most eye-opening experience of my life, i felt weirdly better/changed after that?? 

dont!!!!! go!!!! on!!!! ana!!!! diets!!!! every single persons body is amazing!!!! ana diets lead to malnutrition and feeling terrible all the time and hospitals!!!!! u can eat!!!!! i believe in u!!! u will b even more beautiful than ever if u r healthu and alive!!! 

my body disgusts me, I feel repulsed. hatred. anger. nothing but negativity when I look at the girl staring back at me in the mirror. pointing out every flaw that I have. every scar. every mark. every little thing. every ounce of fat on my body sickens me. sometimes I don’t realise, but I’ll be stood there for 10. 20. 30 minutes just staring at myself, then I’ll realise, I’m crying. I stand and cry. but bad days don’t last forever. 

Guys I need your help so bad. I’m thinking about asking to go inpatient.
My weight isn’t that dangerous but my behaviours… They are.
I take laxatives, skip dinner, binge at breakfast, go to the gym everyday, feel fat, weigh myself every morning…
What do I do please help 

But istead of just giving up completely for the day i actually ate a real dinner of a veggie tempeh wrap 

I have recently been diagnosed with severe anorexia and I never knew I had it. My views of my body were distorted and I thought I was just average and healthy. I would appreciate it if you guys could send me in some tips to recover, thank you so much x 

I had a lot of time on my hands today, which is only expected when you have a five hour break between two classes. Normally, I would spend this time sleeping or doing homework (read: scrolling through Pinterest, tumblr, and various clothing websites). However, due to a message I received this morning, I spent my day thinking about the best way to give advice concerning a very prominent topic in recovery. While there are hundreds of other girls who are more informed about recovery than I, that does not imply that my voice does not have the ability to offer help, be a shoulder to lean on, or offer friendship to those who need it. (Seriously, don’t be afraid to talk to me if you need advice-it doesn’t even have to be recovery related!)For most of us with an eating disorder, exercise is/was a way that we purged calories in an attempt to control the one thing in life that we could: our bodies. I was no exception to this unfortunate norm. Although my case was not as extreme as others who have experienced an exercise compulsion, the relationship I had with working out was far from healthy. Now, I am at a place where I can work out and ignore the voice that tells me to push myself to an extreme. While I still have the voice, it’s dwindling, and I feel like I can exercise for the right reason: because I want to, not my ED. The journey to get to this point was far from easy, but for those of you who are still struggling with this problem, take these steps into mind.1. Take a break from ALL exercise when you begin the refeeding process. I know, I know, this seems impossible, right? I’m not going to lie and tell you that it’s easy because it’s not. You will want to do everything you can in order to avoid sitting still, but it’s what your body needs at this point. You have spent so much time and energy into this addiction that your body is literally shutting down. Your muscles begin to atrophy due to ketosis and you put so much pressure on your heart that it begins to stop functioning-meaning a loss in mass, lowering blood pressure, and possible orthostatic hypotension. By resting, you’ll give your body the time to repair itself to a more normative and healthy state. It also gives your brain time to reform old neuronal connections that are conducive to a healthy state (say bye-bye to those old behaviors)2. Explore different hobbies. One of the best ways to distract yourself during the resting stage of recovery is to engage in activities you once loved. Go the the library or bookstore and pick out types of books that you once loved reading. Look up beginner paintings or drawings on Pinterest and try to recreate them as best as you can. Learn how to knit, play an instrument, or journal (if you’re creative and want to get messy, try Wreck This Journal!). Really, anything that does not involve exercise can be done during this phase.3. Weight Restored and wanting to move around? Start small. Like yoga, stretching, and short walks for month or two small. As a former runner, this was one of the harder things for me to do, but it was also a way that I became more in tune with my body. Even if I wanted to do more, I didn’t let myself. I had spent so much time losing muscle mass that anything else would have been half-assed and too much stress on my body. By stretching, I allowed my body to relearn movement in a gentle way. And don’t think that this won’t be a work out for your muscles-it is. Even now, I’m sore after I have a nice session of stretching.4. The next step. Once I got back into running, I allowed myself one day a week to run. No, this wasn’t some incredibly long distance run either. At most, I let myself run two miles before I stopped and listened to my body. Did my legs hurt? Yes. Could I breath properly? No. Was there a stitch in my side? Yes. I knew that once I felt those things, that it was time to go home. Once I felt myself growing stronger, I let myself work out more. However, there has not been one week where I have worked out every single day. Not only is it incredibly unhealthy for us, but it’s even unhealthy for athletes! This rule goes for any sport/workout that you want to return to. Start with short, basic things. Feel your body throughout them, and limit your time doing them. 5. Refueling. Think that you can eat like you normally do when you engage in activity? Wrong. On days that you workout, you need to add extra into your meal plan. This doesn’t mean half a banana or a rice cake either. I’m talking about adding as much as you burned into your intake, plus some (we burn calories even after we stop working out!). Although most people think of exercise as a way to lose weight, we can’t do that. Once weight is lost, ED finds a foothold and refuses to let go, meaning the voices will come back with a vengeance. Another important thing that you need to do is to not skimp out on carbs and protein. Carbs are the main provider of glycogen in our bodies, which gives us the energy that we need to carry out our daily lives. More carbs equals a better workout and a faster recovery time. My mantra is that pop tarts before bed means more energy in the morning-try it.6. Rest days need to be taken. Seriously, they do the body and mind so much good. I don’t care that you’ve only worked out two days in a row. I don’t care that you don’t think your muscles are sore and need a break. I don’t care if you spend every waking hour in relapse doing exercise while feeling “fine”. You need to rest. Take this into account: I went for a short run Sunday afternoon and woke up Monday morning the sorest I’ve been in a long time. Even though I thought that I could stretch and be fine, I decided to not work out. The result? I woke up feeling normal this morning, and killed my workout after class. At most, I recommend working out three to four times a week.7. Accountability. Having someone to check up on me and make sure I’m following my own rules about exercise has been one of the best things I could have asked for. Have this be a parent, sibling, friend, significant other, or even yourself! If you have a bad day and can’t decide whether you should exercise or not, tell them what you’re feeling and have them give you input. Others are very aware of disordered thoughts and will (hopefully) explain to you what they really hear. If you’re trying to be accountable to yourself, the best way to do this is to make a schedule. Pick the days that you’re going to workout, give yourself a time limit (20-30 minutes is perfect), and write down your post workout snack. Put a checkmark next to a completed workout and another one next to your snack after you’ve eaten it. If you skip your snack, it’s imperative that you add to another meal in order to make up for it. 8. Do it for you. This is probably the most important thing to keep in mind when you begin to exercise again. Any work out you do can’t be because your eating disorder wants you to do it. I’ve had days where all I wanted to do was lay in my bed after class, but my ED was telling me that I needed to put on my Nikes and go run. Do. Not Listen. To. This. Voice. Seriously, don’t. Each time that you disobey the exercise compulsion, you’re one step closer to getting rid of it. If this means that you don’t workout for over a week, that is completely okay. Recreating a healthy relationship with exercise isn’t something that can happen overnight. It’s taken over a year for me to be able to learn from my mistakes, gain weight, and listen to my body when I exercise. With time, patience, and baby steps, I believe that everyone recovering from an exercise compulsion and eating disorder can discover a similar relationship with exercise. For some of us this means short walks and yoga. For others, it is lifting weights and returning to our favorite sport. The key is to find what works for you. If you feel like exercise is leading you to a relapse, take a break until things calm down again.  

(sorry I didn’t post four yesterday ): )Day Four: Three things I like about myself that aren’t physical1.) I’m a good writer2.) I’m a good listener3.) I’m a really good friendDay Five: Treat yourself to a food you love!So I’ll be honest, I totally forgot about this today so I don’t have like a picture or anything, but I did eat chicken tortilla soup which is one of my favorites! 

The weirdest thing just happened. I’ve been having an awesome body image day, and I went to a friends house. They had a scale (my parents have taken mine) and I couldn’t resist. I’ve gained TEN POUNDS since halloween. And at first I was really freaking out, but then I realized, why does it matter? I feel better than I have in a very long time, not to mention I look way better. Plus, thanksgiving was three days ago, and its normal to be a bit heavier after that holiday. But its Christmas now, and while I can’t push the number out of my head, I am learning to be content with it. Recovery win?

Watch please my lovies 

It’s been a whole year now and recovery still doesn’t come easy all days.
Yesterday and today were very difficult. I have had little appetite mostly due to stress and anxiety surrounding school final exams.
Yesterday I restricted the entire day. Today I only restricted until dinner when i forced myself to eat a bowl of a soup with ground tofu. It physically hurt. Ten minutes later I panicked and tried to purge. It used to be so easy I didn’t even need a toothbrush anymore. I could just automatically purge. Today I found it didn’t work. 
And I realized, after crying about it for a couple of minutes, maybe it’s better that way. 
Maybe my body is trying to take care of itself
and maybe I should help. 

 i decided to start this blog as a new way to try and choose recovery 
so if you are a ed recovery blog please like this and ill follow you :) 

I hate feeling guilty about food! Eating is healthy and good and feeling guilty about it is pointless. So what if it’s not as “healthy” as the other things I’ve been eating lately? There are no bad foods. I am feeding my body and that’s okay! <3 

It’s national eating disorder awareness week, so that’s super important. 
So here’s a message from someone who has spent a lot of time dealing with one and continues to this day, 
Eating disorders are simply that. A disorder. You don’t just visit a therapist, or go to rehab, get help and then your fixed. Eating disorders take constant fixing. You’re never fully recovered. 
Watch Demi Lovato’s documentary from MTV (it’s triggering so be wary) STAY STRONG. She has an awesome quote she says in it that goes “I don’t think I’m fixed. People think you’re like a car in a body shop. You go in, they fix you up and you’re out and you work like you’re brand new. It doesn’t work like that. It takes constant fixing.” Recovery doesn’t have a day off. Everyday is a constant reminder to continue recovery. 
Unfollow those triggering blogs. Seriously. I deleted and recreated a whole tumblr blog because I was following too many triggering blogs and all my content was depressive and only held me back. If you want help, YOU have to get it. No one can get it for you. Make that decision and work everyday to get to the goal of recovery. Baby steps.
Remember that YOU ARE WORTH RECOVERY. You are worthy of loving yourself. Your body is a temple, treasure it. Love it. Cherish it. 
Relish in the fact that you are original and unique. 
Stop hating your legs 
Stop hating your stomach 
Stop hating yourself because he chose her because she has big boobs. He’s wasn’t worth it anyway. 
Stop looking in the mirror and only seeing what’s wrong. 
You are worthy. You are BEAUTIFUL. 
I know what you feel. I know what it’s like to skip meals, or to talk so much during dinner people around you don’t notice the fact that you’ve just been moving your food around to make it look like you ate something. Or to run into the bathroom trying to convince yourself that if you can just make yourself puke this once, you won’t do it again. Going to bed with your stomach growling and having that bizarre sense of relief and pride. 
It’s scary, it’s real and It’s NOT CUTE. 
It’s disorder that is too often overlooked. 

If you or anyone you know is suffering with anorexia, bulimia, BED, etc PLEASE don’t hesitate to message me. 
Also, the NEDA (National Eating Disorder Association) has a hotline: (800) 931-2237 Call it. 
Purple is the color! Wear it to show your support. 💜
2 years of recovery and counting 😊 It’s possible. 

Remember when I used to drink Coke Zero even though I like Diet 100 x better? Because my ED prevented me from having something enjoyable??? 
(And now all I drink is water, tea and coffee because I can’t stand soda. Hah!) 

It’s almost Chrsitmas and I know you’re very worried about all the food, weight gain and that shit.We all know how hard it is to stay strong at Christmas, but you have to. I know you can. So I want to give you some “advices” or something. -First of all, IT’S CHRISTMAS!!!! I love Christmas haha Enjoy it!!-Don’t focus on the food, focus on enjoying these days with your family. I usually don’t meet all my family so, being together is incredible. -Seeing all the food in the table causes so much anxiety so breathe, you’ll be okay. Maybe having your phone with you may help, talk to your closest friends or vent on Tumblr. We are always here to help.-If you do not know how to control the amount of food, tell your mother or father to control it for you. It can be really helpfull trust me.- You’re not going to gain a lot of weight.-Think about all the times you didn’t enjoy Christmas because you ED. It’s time to do it!! You deserve it.-Please, don’t purge, don’t starve yourself, don’t self-harm. This is very tempting, but is not good for you. You have to fight agains this thoughts.Please, STAY STRONG ALL OF YOU these holidays (and always of course). YOU CAN DO IT, I BELIEVE IN YOU.  I’m here for everyone, if you need to talk, or just to vent, I’m here. Okay? LOVE YOU ALL. 

Stop promoting an healthy body image and “all bodies are beautiful” but then only posting photoshopped pictures of skinny and fit and “perfect” models, mix it up, post some more chubby girls once in a while, do it for all the girls who feel “not skinny enough”
do it for an healthier body image
stop blaming the media and society, and start working on the problem!

                Lines from my diary (2014). Path to the recovery            


Stepped on the scale this morning and it screamed “110 pounds!” at me! It feels like years ago that I weighed 145 pounds and I starved myself and hurt myself and everybody around me all the time. I look in the mirror and I can start to see tiny abs forming from taekwando three times a week and I can’t help but grin. I feel so confident and in control, I can’t express it. My hope is to get down to 100 pounds continuing with healthy eating and weekly workouts, only ten more pounds to go but for once I’m not scared or obsessing over it. I feel like I’m finally in control of my life again which is weird and different.  

Hey you :)in case anybody is actually reading this: IF YOU NEED HELP I WILL TRY TO HELP YOU!Recently I’ve scrolled a lot through the ed tags since a good friend of mine had just beaten ana. I’m quite worried about how many are suffering under their ed.So if you’re just looking for somebody to talk to or whatever then message me! Either on my tumblr or my email (sofia-poeschl@t-online.de) I’m no professional whatsoever but maybe that’s what you’re looking for? I don’t want to judge you, I will try to help you as best as I can. Stay strong! Love, Sofia 

I am personally upping my intake today
Only been awake 3 hours and I’ve already had a bowl of cereal, bacon sandwich, pint of orange squash, can of cola and a bag of chocolate buttons.
COME AT ME WEIGHT GAIN????????? 

Breakfast: 1 bowl bran flakes w/ ff milk, 2 soft-boiled eggs (<3!!), large bowl of cherries, handful of walnutsSnack: EnsureLunch: seafood & egg fried rice, lemon teaSnack: 3 shortbread cookies (walker’s christmas edition!), ff greek yogurt (170g pot)Dinner: turnip beef shank stew, veggies, 1 bowl rice Snack: 4 pieces of assorted chocolate, small appleThe fried rice for lunch was a fear food because it was restaurant-made and idk how much oil they put in it. It went okay but it’s definitely something I still need to work on. 

Today I hit my goal weight for recovery, and even though I think I look like a beached whale I’m healthy, and I look more alive. Let’s hope this keeps up :) 

I’m alone and I beat the Ana voice.
KIND bar is amazing. 

Nobody’s gonna see your thigh gap when you’re in a coffin. 

I’m so awfully unhappy at the moment and struggling and just everything has become too much!!! I’m lonely and stressed and tired and don’t know what to do.
I want help but I’m just not sick enough yet…..I hate the logic of this disorder. 

broken out of my lapse and feeling all the better for it
easily hit minimums today, feeling much more fab now :) 

Breakfast: baked apple pie oatmeal with loooots of soy milk and crunchy granola on top. This was sooo nice and worth the extra hour.
Lunch: perfect avocado open faced sandwiches with tomato, himalaya pink salt, 5 different sorts of pepper and balsamico.
Snack: turkish yogurt with organic cornflakes, pumpkin kernels, banana, agave and sunflower seeds. An iced coffee.
Dinner: Homemade goat cheese new potato gnocchi with pesto and parmesan. 
Night snack: Frozen yogurt, some iced coffee (lets face it, I drink way too much iced coffee) 

If you are a recovery blog that dose not post pictured of food (i can’t it triggers me somehow) please like this and ill check out your blog 

Having a really bad body image day, someone help :/ 

And I’m not even upset.  
eating disorder culture is always using your fingers to eat the crumbs left over in a bag of snacks  
Reason #1593I want to recover to be there for my friends the way they have been there for me  
Lovelies 💕❤️🐥The “deserves to love and nourish themselves” is stored in the you ❤️💕 
Hey! Summer is coming up and its easier to binge more than ever since I’m home alone all the time, and I’m sure many of you feel the same. I’m looking for an Ana or a Mia buddy, to help keep me in check and keep me competitive since im trying to lose around 40 lb this summer. If you meet some of the all of the stuff and even some of the stuff on this list, hmu! -have an ed (required)-live with your parents (makes it hard to purge/fast/etc.) -goal weight is 100-110 lb -forced to eat lots of meals you dont want to -can text on an iphone (msg me for my #) -willing to become friends/talk about other stuff besides ed sometimes (talk about interests and stuff) -pro-recovery  
fyi there is no such thing as “getting back on track” after the holidays because you were never “off track” you were simply living life because you are a human being and you deserve that 
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
My Dietitian:
                                                Your body actually requires food to function and keep you alive.                    Me:
                                                Okay...that sounds fake but okay.                    
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
Eating is 100% okay. We need to eat to live. We need calories for energy. And sometimes, eating makes us happy. So eat today. Eat for you!🌈💞💟

you know what doesn’t matter? what other people are eating. seriously. stop. just because your friend karen got a salad does not mean you shouldn’t have the pizza. order that fucking pizza and do not for a second think you’re worth any less than her 

That food is simply a conglomeration of energy and nutrients that help power your cells which keep you breathing and thinking and movingThat calories have no moral valueThat weight is an arbitrary measure of your relationship to Earth’s gravitational pull and in the scope of the universe the difference between Earth’s gravitational pull on any given human compared to any other human is infinitesimally insignificantThat the mirror will lie to youThat you are not a bad person for taking care of yourself or nourishing yourself or addressing your needs or taking up space 

 

the way your family treats you is not a reflection of who you are. you are not a bad person. please don’t forget that. you are not a bad person.  

and realise how very brilliant you are at surviving. Panic attacks, bullying, difficult relationships, physical health problems, mental illness?YOU SURVIVED ITSuicidal thoughts, plans, even attempts?YOU SURVIVED ITNot thinking you could live another day?YOU SURVIVED ITAnything that’s really hard right now?YOU’RE GONNA SURVIVE IT 

having diabetes doesn’t make you any less beautifulhaving scars from your injections doesn’t make you any less beautifulhave a cathedar for your pump doesn’t make you any less beautifulneeding to eat more than other people doesn’t make you any less beautifulany weight you gained after your diagnosis doesn’t make you any less beautifulhaving callouses on your fingers from blood pricks doesn’t make you any less beautifulhaving diabetes doesn’t make you any less beautiful 

Same 

friendly reminder that you’re never going to look back on your life when you’re 80 years old and wish you had spent more time counting calories and less time living  

Tumblr is the only place I can talk about my eating disorder because I know everyone understands  

Happy ThanksgivingYou are allowed to enjoy your food, to eat according to your preferences, to eat to the point of satisfactionYou deserve to enjoy this holiday, however that may look to you (NOT to your ED, or judgmental/unkind relatives)You can eat thanksgiving dinner AND eat breakfast and lunch and snacksYou can eat thanksgiving dinner AND all your meals AND not compensate for it before/after the holidayIt is also okay to struggle with this day and have negative emotions….remember you’re not alone in that. We’re all in this together.If the people around you make harmful comments about food/dieting/eating/anything tbh….It is not meant for you. It does not apply to you. Imagine you’re in a bubble/force field/etc and let those comments bounce right off. You have overcome so much and are so strong and you can get through these painful moments.I’m thankful for all of my followers and for everyone who is here, reading this, despite the difficult battles they are fighting. I’m thankful that you continue to fight <3 

 that health is a state of being, not a body type 

YOU DON’T NEED AN EXCUSE TO EAT 

Me with an eating disorder: I’m in control Narrator: she was not in control  

I mean, accurate. 

cut your hair!!!! cry in public!!!! wear socks and sandals for all you care!!!! act on your feelings!!!! never settle for ‘not that bad’ !!!! fall in love no matter how many times your heart was broken!!!! kiss who you want!!!! eat what you crave!!!! forgive yourself!!!! take up as much space!!!! make art!!!! appreciate art!!!! study what you love and work on your passions!!!! you’re not anyone’s property!!!! kiss boys kiss girls kiss everything in between!!!! pet every lil’ cat you see!!!! love love love love!!!! 

What sucks so much about having crazy distorted body image is one moment I’ll be like “I am literally the finest, hottest creature on the planet” but within half a second I’m suddenly the most disgusting, repulsive piece of flesh ever to walk to earth and there is literally NO IN BETWEEN. 

I wish I was able to disappear at willLike //poof//You know??It sounds useful…~ ☆ 

something that’s stuck with meseeing people recovered on instagram. and not ‘recovered’, but actually embracing how they look and eating freely — cake, pizza, ice cream, yet also salads, fruits, veggies.they’re proof that recovery is REAL and that it’s WORTH IT.if recovery wasn’t worth it like your eating disorder tells you, then why have these people stayed recovered when they could have gone back? why would they not return to their eating disorder if it was as shit as our ed’s tell us?because it isn’t. it’s worth it, and these people are proof. proof that you can succeed without it, proof that you can be happy without it, proof that you DON’T NEED IT.

                cacophony             


 

their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.  

They can look like fearing carbs and fats and they can look like carefully planned ‘junk food’.They can look like drinking litres of water and they can look like a fear of liquids.They can look like constant adrenaline-fueled activity and they can look like being unable to move.They can look like strict regimes and they can look like a jumbled mess.They can look like constant checking in mirrors and they can look like a fear of your reflection.They can look like loved ones begging you to change and they can look like nobody knowing there’s a problem. They can look like drips and tubes and they can look like being physically healthy.They can look like relapses and recovery attempts and they can look like never changing.They can look like countless behaviours always changing and they can look like the same thing every day.They can look like isolating yourself from the world and they can look like an active social life.They can look like years of treatment and they can look like never getting help.They can look like understanding that there is a problem and they can look like complete denial.There is no one image of someone with an eating disorder, as there is no one image of someone with a broken leg, someone with cancer, someone with a virus. 

FATS ARE FRIENDS! 

stop listening to serving sizes and start listening to your body  

You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 

 


 

FYI constantly depriving yourself of foods you enjoy because you want your “goal” body is more unhealthy than eating what you truly want 

In case no one has told you recently:You are enoughYou can take up spaceYou are loved 

Being healthy isn’t about eating nothing but salads, fruits, veggies, etc. It’s about those days where you decide to say “screw it” and eat pizza, french fries, chocolate, etc, and then the next day decide to eat a bit better. It’s not depriving your body of what it needs, as well as what you want, but having balance.﻿

 

please remember that just because someone’s recovery looks a certain way does not mean that yours needs to look that way too. recovery is about becoming friends with your body again - YOUR body. so listen to it. honor it. trust it.  

listen up disordered folki have been informed of some pretty shitty stuff happening in the community, and here are a few common sense remindersdon’t post body checks if you are under 18dont fucking send anon hate to others, i stg if i find out ur calling other ppl fat on anon i will throw handsdont tell people in recovery shit about their weight or how they shouldnt recover. remember, hands will be thrownblock creepy peopledelete the hate and go on with your daydont give out tips, idiotsdont fucking write meanspo and say its for yourself, if it were, it would be private!!!!!!! be kind!!! and welcoming!!!! not so hard to do!!!!!ignore people who are assholesblur out your face from body checksdont fast for more than 3 days my dudes its dangerous af, especially if you are already malnourishedok that was all, please use common sense and i know there are a lot of kids there so i just wanted to remind yall of what i thought was obvious!!! stay safe bitches!!!!!!

me: 

To everyone who is planning their relapse today - I hear you. Your pain is real, our world is frightening, and I am so, so sorry.But please remember that you are needed here. More than ever, this world needs you to fight. You can be the good among all of this hate. Stand tall, take a deep breath, and pick up your sword. Your presence makes a difference, even if you cannot find a way to speak. Let this be your victory, not his.

Hey just some lil things for you to remember!You haven’t eaten too much (even if you binged)Any food is good food!You need carbs, fats, fibre and sugars! Have a look up the daily recommended intake of those if you want more info, but don’t obsess over it! It is just a recommended intake amount.Your body looks gorgeous today! Everything about it is stunning ♥Don’t purge please, it’ll make you feel worse and it doesn’t even get rid of calories, don’t hurt yourself over food.Please be wary of pro-ana/mia blogs! They will just make your mindset worse, surround yourself with happy and positive things and people.Keep exercise to a reasonable amount for your intake.You are loved and you are beautiful, I promise!If you need someone to talk to I’m always here ^u^ 

It’s okay to feel whatever you are feeling. Your feelings are valid. You are not “overreacting” and you are not “being too sensitive” and you don’t need to “just get over it.” Don’t listen to people who tell you otherwise. 

 

some things i have learnt about eating disorder recovery:
- if a food makes you happy or you crave it a lot, have some! depriving yourself of food is just gonna make you crave it more and when you finally snap you will binge eat 10x more bad things than if you just had this one small thing
- recovery takes time !!! lots of time !! ive had my ed for 5 years and ive fallen in and out of recovery and its hard but it is doable!!! 
- ive lost more weight nourishing my body with healthy things and exercising a few times a week than i ever did starving myself
- self love is not a sudden thing. no one wakes up entirely in love with themselves. it takes time and energy and yes ! its okay not to like certain things about yourself but they make you unique and most of the time they cant be changed and thats okay!!!
- thigh gaps r not for everyone!!! not everyone can achieve a thigh gap! it completely depends on your bone structure, you could be at the lowest weight possible and still not have a thigh gap because of your bone structure but thats okay! thigh gaps do not determine your worth as a human (but if you do have a thigh gap thats fine too! everyones bodies are different)
- eat more fruit and veggies!!! honestly!!! blend them in a smoothie or cook them or eat them with chocolate, who cares!!! they will help ur skin, ur hair and ur mood as well as many other benefits. try and eat at least 2 or 3 portions a day because yes theyre expensive and not everyone can manage 5 a day. 
- u are allowed to treat urself with unhealthy food!!! ur body is smart and can cope with u eating a slice of cake or a bar of chocolate
- u should not fear food!!! food is ur friend!!! especially healthy foods, but also unhealthy foods for when u need them.
- throwing up your food does more damage than it ever will do good. it is so bad for ur emotional and physical well being and is found to make u gain more weight than lose it ! 
- u shouldnt feel the need to lose weight. if u want to do it in a healthy way thats ur choice but people see more in you than just a number or a body i promise
- your ed will not vanish overnight. it takes months, maybe years of recovery to feel fully recovered but you can get better everyday and it will be so worth it when you look back and think about how far u have come !!! ❤️ 

ok ok but ya know what i’m realizing?? HAVING AN EATING DISORDER IS SUCH A WASTE OF MY LIFE. in the time I devote to my ED, how many more people could I help?? how many more laughs could I have? how many more breathless moments could I experience? how many beautiful runs could I go on? how much of the patriarchy could i crush?? I AM JUST DONE. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR. THIS IS NOT WHO I AM. I CANNOT CHANGE THE WORLD WHILE HAVING AN EATING DISORDER 

today is world eating disorders action day. thank you @nedafeedinghope for providing these 9 truths about eating disorders. please reblog to spread awareness- and remember, you are not alone 🌟💖 

NOT ALL FAT PEOPLE WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT 

- Your ED is lying to you- Losing more weight will not make you love yourself more- Losing weight will not make the people around you love you any more than what they already do- Eating normally again will truly make you feel better physically and mentally- Weight loss does not cure a negative body image.  And long as you continue to have a negative view of yourself, you will never like how you look, no matter how much weight you lose. 

Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 

 

Made a little floral doodle….anyone have any requests? x 

literally anyone: oh wow !! you look so pretty and h E a L t H y haha good job !! me:  

please forgive yourself because you are a human being and you deserve that 

Turning to your eating disorder when you’re going through a hard time won’t make things easier for you. It’s not going to solve your problems and you’re not going to be happier just because you’re feeding into the disordered thoughts.  

PSA 🌸 LADIES/LADDIES/AND NON-BINARY PALSLISTEN THE FUCK UPif you are having chest pains, dizzy spells, severe hunger nausea, spotty vision, heart palpitationsyou ! need ! to ! eat ! it does not have to be a full meal! but PLEASE eat something— you could be experiencing hypoglycemia, which is extremely dangerous and ana’s are particularly prone to due to extensive periods of fasting/severe calorie restrictioneat something with CARBS & SUGAR to get those blood sugars back up. energy gels are a quick and easy way to do this. I know we all want to lose weight, but please be safe and take care of yourself— if you are going to restrict/fast, please try to reduce harm to yourself as much as possibleI love this community so much. please take care of yourselves, and please always know that you can reach out to me if you need to talk. 🌸  

Sometimes it is planning relapses late into the night, and then getting up the next morning and making breakfast regardless of how much you want to run in the opposite direction. Sometimes it feels like you are losing all control over your life and that every little change is magnified a thousands times over.But just because you feel this way right now, and may spend hours planning your next relapse, it does not mean that you have ‘failed’ or ‘messed up’. No.Recovery is a journey; it is a learning curve. It is not always going to be a straight road, but that’s okay, no one said that it was going to be ‘easy’.Your feelings and emotions, whatever they may be, are very real and valid.  You are allowed to feel this way. And yes, it is okay to be having ‘second’ thoughts, however don’t lose sight of the reality of the situation; don’t let yourself get caught up in the numbers and the games. This is your life at stake here; and you are currently playing with fire. Giving into those disordered thoughts may ease your anxiety in the short-term, however it won’t last long, and it will always come back for ‘more’. Relapse is not the answer. Although the storms may be raging in this moment, they will not last forever. They will pass by and the waters will settle. You can and you will get through this. Hold on. 

It’s never too lateUnless you believe so.

                I need you to know I am slowly coming to terms with all of this 


Your body’s response when you treat it right (LOVE THIS!) 

So I was reminding myself to stay away from triggering content on here and I casually had the thought “it’ll make you sicker and you are already sick enough.” My ED has spent years yelling at me about how I’m not “sick enough” to actually have an eating disorder, to actually have a real problem, to go to treatment, to ask for support, to deserve the help I’m getting, etc. I have at times been so convinced me that no matter how deep I am in my disorder, I’m never really sick, I’m never “sick enough.” A lot of people who have struggled with ED’s understand this line of thought. So you might then understand how totally taken aback I was to have the thought “you are already sick enough” without consciously trying to fight the ED or reappraise thoughts. Reminder to everyone that you and your feelings and your illness are valid. If you are even questioning if you’re sick, and if you’re having doubts that you’re not sick enough, you absolutely deserve help. You don’t deserve to feel sick at all, and you definitely don’t deserve to feel like you should be “sicker”….weaker, in more pain, suffering more, etc. I hope the inner compassionate voice that showed up for me tonight (for the first time in a long time) shows up for you too <3 

Me, after being in highly intensive treatment for over two weeks 

Do you guys ever wonder how life would be without an eating disorder? No more binging. No more starving.No more purging. No more canceling plans.No more losing friendships. No more wearing loose clothing. No more being stuck in your room. No more endless thoughts about food. No more fighting. Just pure happiness…  

It was a struggle at first to accept my new body. It was a struggle to say, “I’m bigger than I used to be,” and not go into a panicked frenzy. Sometimes I still wish I was smaller, but really - most days I don’t care. I feel so much better without my eating disorder, and so much happier, too. And finding clothes that fit, accepting that for now this is my size, shopping for the body I have now and not the body I want - it’s made such a difference for my self confidence. Here’s to feeling good, being curvy, and being cute as heck. 

You know you’re really working recovery when you still eat when it hurts the very most 

 

If you are in recovery PLEASE don’t compare your daily intake to other people on here who are also in recovery!  A lot of the “recovery meal plans” I’ve seen in the tags are still pretty small.  It can be triggering to see the tiny portions other people are eating.  Don’t worry if your meals are bigger, or if you eat more snacks throughout the day!  Everyone’s recovery plan is a little different, and it’s important that you are following a diet that is most suitable to YOUR needs

It is ok to eat candy!It is ok to enjoy candy!It is ok not to eat candy…but try to listen to the real you, not your disorder, and if you want candy, try to take that step to eat some and enjoy it! You deserve it and it is so so okay to eat and like things that taste good! That being said this can be a triggering time, especially for those who struggle with bingeing. Take good care of yourself and be gentle with you!!! Feel free to message me if you need to talk to someone.It can also be isolating to be struggling/experiencing fear/anxiety around something while everyone around you is celebrating and partying and excited. It is ok to struggle sometimes. You are not alone!Happy Halloween!!!

Panda Express at work LIKE A BOSS 

 

Suicide Prevention Month day 1: IT GETS BETTER.
The first picture is of me at age seven, which is when I first began to experience suicidal ideation. I had severe depression/anxiety/PTSD as a result of abuse from my biological family, and my desire to die stemmed from that. Looking back, it is horrifically tragic that I wanted to kill myself at such a young age –but at the time (and in the many years that followed), my death wish felt perfectly rational. After all, for my whole life, things had only gotten worse as far as my family’s treatment of me and my emotional state. By the time I was 19 and left my biological family, I had been suicidal for over a decade, and had actually attempted more than once. And even once I was free from the abuse, things were STILL bad – I was on my own in the world with no family to fall back on or come home to, I was struggling to get proper medical treatments and work/pay bills, and I wanted to die more than ever. At this point, it felt like I had every reason to give up and end it all, because never in my life had things ever gotten much “better”. I thought I had every reason to kill myself – but there was one big thing stopping me: hope. 
Even in my absolute worst moments, when no other person was there for me, I had my hope. I had the little voice inside of me that whispered “keep going”, and the tiny flicker of light that refused to be overpowered by the overwhelming dark. I had my hope, and nothing could take that away from me. So I held on to that small flame, and fanned it until it became a raging fire. I reached out to friends and professionals for support, I advocated for myself, and I fought like hell against everything in the world and in my mind that wanted to hold me back. When depression shouted at me to kill myself, I shouted even louder that I was going to keep living. Even with shaking hands and tears in my eyes, I stood up and pressed onward because deep down, I had faith that one day, it would get better – and get better it did.
The second picture is of me today. Today, where I still struggle at times, but am no longer suicidal. I no longer want to die, because despite everything that ever held me down, I finally built a life that I would consider 100% worth living. Things finally began to look up for me, even in the face of everything bad I had been through. A couple of months ago, a friend I reached out to put me in contact with a really amazing couple, who talked about adopting me into their family – and shortly after, that discussion became a reality when I moved to California to be with them. Not long after arriving here, I got the puppy I’d always wanted (to go along with the safe, loving family I’d dreamed of) and started seeing a very skilled therapist to work on the things I still struggle with. Soon, I will be starting college classes and taking music lessons to pursue the things I’m really passionate about. Overall, my life is full of love and joy, and I would not trade it for the world. 
And the thing is, none of this would have happened if I had not kept living. None of this would have been possible had I at any point gone all the way and actually killed myself. Had that happened, I would have been dead, and my story would have gotten that tragic ending instead of the happy one it has now. I guess what I am getting at here in this novel of a post is that IT GETS BETTER, but in order for that to happen, you have to LIVE. So please, if you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, do not give in. There IS hope, and a there IS light at the end of the tunnel. All you have to do is keep fighting in order to get there. 💙 

There is a point in recovery, when the wins feel like losses and barely anyone is left clapping because you’ve tackled a fear you’ve food you’ve had for years. You no longer feel like rewarding yourself because you’re not sure whether you believe in what you’re doing anymore.There is a point in recovery that feels so mind numbingly boring because you are no longer in the depths of your illness (and yes, it is an illness) but you have not yet reached optimum health. No one is watching you anymore. You think it’ll be easy to slip back into old habits.So listen up, it will be long and it will be painful. It will often be harder than being in the depths of your eating disorder (I promise the belief you were not ‘sick enough’ is your disorder talking) and it will feel like it is never ending. Push through it. You don’t have to believe me. You don’t have to listen to me. But you’re close. You’re so close to life you can almost touch it.Reach out.   

my mom coming home from work after being gone all day: have you eaten today?me: yesalso me: 

I have not eaten Panera Mac and cheese in like four years because of the calories, and today I had a small bowl and that is progress my friends. 

 

And for the first time in a long time I am more tired than proud of being sick. I no longer wear it proudly it like a medal, I am tired of having to say no to things and all these habits I have fallen into. It is more painful than exciting.

What are some things that you wish treatment providers were more aware of when treating LGBTQ+ people with eating disorders? 



Skinny aesthetic  

The sickness is not in your new lowest weight or a confirmed diagnosis. The sickness is in the way you’re abusing your body and believe that it’s okay. 

I have had bulimia for about 1 and a half yearToday i threw up blood for the first timeI knew what would happen to me if i kept goingYou know why i stopped there?I suddenly understood what got me hereI suddenly wanted to pick up my phone and say “i am so sorry” to my boyfriend, my sister, my parents and the friends i no longer haveI suddenly realized why i wouldn’t be able to recall the faces of people i’ve talked with for the past 17 months, only what diet i was on then and how many calories i’d eaten that dayAll i have lost, i have lost to this. Food. My bf has a girlfriend that prioritieses food more than him, my sister has a little sister that couldn’t come to her graduation because she had eaten too much and felt fat that day, my parents has a daughter that lies about the money she asked for so she could “buy groceries for the week” and instead bought crap food so she could purge it up and wonder what happend to her and her life all whilst looking down at bloody vomit. No one deserves this. No one in my life deserves to be less important to me than food. I dont deserve to be less important than food. This is what i suddenly understood as i looked at my bloody vomit, knowing well it could be the end of me if i continued. So i stopped

I’m just so very v e r y 
tired… 

When I stand up to my eating disorder by deciding not to act on a behavior, but the eating disorder retaliates by suggesting a different behavior 

Let’s face it, there will be people in your recovery who won’t support you. Maybe more than who will support you. Nevertheless, it’s up to you how you will deal with their lack of empathy and understanding.First of all, let me get something straight! You are NOT the one to blame for your eating disorder. No matter how many people tell you this, no matter how many times you will hear that you were the one in control, you did this to yourself, so you can also cure yourself, it’s not true. In the beginning of my recovery, I was also in this state of confusion. Why did I do it? Why didn’t I see there was a problem? Why did I listen to the voice in my head? Let me tell you one thing; eating disorders are mental illnesses that consume you like a virus and if you don’t have healthy coping mechanisms to fight against them, they will spread and spread until there’s nothing left of you. This wasn’t your choice, mental illnesses are called mental illnesses for a reason. As my psychologist said: you can’t choose be mentally ill or not but you can choose to overcome it and fight for recovery.So onto the said question, how you will deal with unsupportive people in recovery is up to you, I can only tell you my tips and experiences. They may not work for you but I hope I can help you with this post. First, let’s look at some types of unsupportive people.Type 1: The one who wouldn’t admit that they’ve hurt you pre-ED and it worsened during your EDThis is probably the hardest one to deal with. Eating disorders just as other mental illnesses go back to years before you first started acting up on the urges to restrict/binge/purge/overexercise etc.. The root causes are unknown to the sufferers until they start working with a professional (or at least they were unknown to me), and even after that, they can still feel that something is missing. These people would often belittle your problem, make you feel like you are only complaining to gain more attention while they would never ever admit that they’ve said hurtful things to you when you were younger, set too high expectations, criticised or humiliated you, neglected your emotional needs, picked on you (let it be your grades, behaviour or appearance) and made themselves look like the victims when others were around. If you can, of course it’s better to talk to them, however after not seeing any progress, it might be better if you didn’t expect too much from them. They may or may not feel guilty of what they’ve done but they wouldn’t admit it for the world. I suggest talking to someone else you trust (let it be a supportive family member or a professional) because it helps to vent. Also, whenever they hurt you and they don’t take it seriously when you tell them how you feel, write 

 down your feelings. Writing a journal, keeping track of your emotions is essential to identify how you feel.Type 2: The narrow-minded one who thinks that it was only about losing weight to please others, especially boysHonestly, the only thing you can do to help them understand your problem is by talking to them or suggesting that they should look up the term ‘eating disoders’ on the net. They probably won’t do anything about it but at least you’ve tried.Type 3: The older generation relative/acquaintance who doesn’t know the definition of mental illness and says that it was only you being stupid and rebelliousFor me, it was my grandmother who sad that I was stupid and only hurting my mother with what I was doing. When I told her it’s not that simple, it’s a mental illness, she merely shook her head. Come to think of it, when she was young, eating disorders weren’t even a thing. They weren’t classified as psychological illnesses. So you can actually imagine why they don’t know anything about EDs or what causes them. Try to be patient with them and if they really bug you, show them articles or tell them to ask questions because you think they can’t fully grasp what’s an ED is about.Type 4: The one who only cares about numbers and once you gain the weight back, they think that you’re curedI’m going to be honest, being straight-forward is the best in this case. Telling them that it’s going to be a life-long struggle and weight restoration is only a part of it is crucial. Not only will it make you feel better but you can also let them know that it’s not as easy as it seems. Actually, after I’ve told this Type 4 person about it, he didn’t ask anything regarding my anorexia anymore. I don’t know if it’s a good thing or not but at least he calmed down. Plus, involving a professional and asking them to tell that person that reinforcing the idea of avoiding weight-ins would be the best for your recovery.Type 5: The one who doesn’t think you have a problem, let alone need the help of a psychologist because they can cure youWhat I did was to go and see a professional myself and started therapy because I knew I needed it. There are times in your life when YOU have to take action and if it’s something regarding your health (both mental and physical), you should go for it, no matter what anyone says. Some people wouldn’t make an effort to look at something from a different point of view, so no matter what they do, you are the only one who knows how you feel and if you need help from a professional (which I highly recommend), don’t let anyone tell your otherwise. What can they do anyway? Keep you locked in your room because they don’t want you to attend therapy?Type 6: The one who’s not socially sensitive and thinks that it was just an extreme dietThis is outright inconsiderate and probably one of the most hurtful things you can tell someone with an ED. They are probably the ones who have never had a problem with their appearance and never even gave diets a second thought. That’s why they don’t know what’s the difference between an ED and a diet. After being told about the issue, they are still convinced it’s just a made-up thing.Type 7: The one who wouldn’t stop commenting on your weight, appearance, clothes, exercise, not even after specifically being asked not toSome people just love this topic. Some people like being completed and need to be reassured that they look good, that the dress they had bought is pretty and that they are doing everything right health-wise. I feel like these people are the ones who can swing from one end to the other and feel very insecure about their weight/appearance but try not to show it by putting others down. In this case, being aware of the fact that you have your own unique and beautiful body and no should should tell you how to look and what to do to look a certain way is vital. Whenever I feel angry after a comment from these people, I usually say something back like ‘I’m happy with the way I am’ and ‘Confidence is not weight-based’ to try to snap back at them and also to reassure myself. It’s also a good idea to watch lots of body positive videos and read lots of articles on the topic. It really helped me to deal with the unnecessary amount of comments.All in all, communication is key. You can try to talk to people and maybe it will help, maybe it won’t. Unless you do it, you’ll never know. However, don’t expect too much from some people. What I’ve learned is that the worries regarding the lack of support will go away as you regain self-confidence and are in a better phase of your recovery. Once you realise that you are the only one who needs to be okay with herself/himself and they way you look, it’s going to be better. You’ll gradually care less about them. Until then, read lots of body positive articles, watch lots of videos, listen to other sufferers’ stories and try to talk to supportive friends/relative/professionals about it. Believe me, it helps to let it all out. If you feel better, you can also vent in other healthy ways such as reading, drawing, listening to music, doing any kinds of arts, watching movies and going on a walk. What matters is that you don’t let it slide, you deal with all your frustration and anger and you let it out. Don’t hold it in, okay? You can also come and talk to me if you wish. My ask box is always open but you can message me privately too. <3Keep fighting, warriors! 

calorieless flavoured water

they’re relatively cheap and are available at grocery stores, gas stations, anywhere.
stay safe ( or idk do what u want ) 💛 

When a friend of a friend is saying inaccurate, stereotypical, insulting things about people with eating disorders but I don’t feel comfortable calling them on their bullshit because drama could ensue and I hate conflict 



Today is No Diet Day! A day to bring awareness and stop perpetuation of diet culture. The truth is, diets don’t work. More than 95% of dieters will regain the weight they lost. Oftentimes, people gain back even more. When deprived, the body goes into survival mode, craving what you’ve been restricting and leading to binges. Only when we ditch the diet and relearn how to listen to our bodies can true food freedom (and mental freedom!) be found. There is SO MUCH more to life than losing weight.  

FUCKI was sending memes to my friend in bulk and accidentally sent her this one AND NOW SHES ASKING WHAT ED MEANS AND I CANT TELL HER CAUSE SHE’LL BE CONCERNED THE IRONY OH MY 

shoutout to ppl with:-very round tums-tums that roll when you sit or bend over-tums that always have rolls-tums with cellulite or stretch marks-tums with large rib cages -tums that have outtie belly buttons-tums that have innie belly buttons-tums that sit over your pants just a wee bit-tums with scars that are either from self-harm or an operation/surgery of some sortyour tummy is cute and very important and there is no need to be ever be ashamed of it.   

It’s been so long since I have been on here.While I was gone I got pregnant, gained over 20kgs (44lbs) and had a beautiful daughter.She is now 1 year old and the light of my life. She is a reason to get up in the morning, a  reason to look after my body so I can be with her for as long as I possibly can.I breastfed for 9 months and lost the weight I had gained and then some.I feel frustrated by the positive feedback I am receiving for my low weight and I worry about how I can protect my innocent daughter from it all. 

omg i have SO MANY examples of edited thinspo and i wanna post all of them at once bc i found SO MANY examples from thinspo i absolutely idolized and made me suffer!!!!! but i’m trying to post them one by one, slowly, so i won’t saturate the tag and get banned/reported by ppl who are so sick they wanna live this delusion…………. goddd i hate this!!!!!!!!!! 

Yesterday I was over at my boyfriends house and he kept asking me why I couldn’t sleep the night before (it was bc of the period problems I have been having, it was killing me inside) I told him that I don’t want to annoy him with my problems anymore but he kept asking and pushing me to say what’s wrong so I told him that my ED is causing my periods to stop and that if I don’t start eating more again, there’s a high chance that I will not be able to have children in the future. His face was heartbreaking to look at. Though we’ve only been together for 5 months, we keep talking about how our children would look like and stuff like that. And he keeps telling me how I’m the first person in his life he can imagine having kids with. He was like “Wait.. really? Oh.. shit.” And that’s when I realized that this ED is not only harming me, but the people around me. He asked me “And what can we do about that?” I told him I don’t know. I told him that it is impossible for me to eat more at the moment, because it would kill me mentally. I kinda poured my heart out at him though “ana” was screaming at me not to do it. He kinda is my strength and my anchor and venting to him is my only escape from this disease. He handled it all so well and said “well baby what about increasing your daily calorie intake to.. 500? not more. not less. Just 500. And you work yourself up step by step.” He could have said “Oh My GoD EaT MoRe HeRe eAt tHiS BaGel” but he didn’t. I don’t know what I did to deserve him. He’s so gentle with it all because he knows how sensitive I am and that I could break like glass any second. Anyways.. I lost 0.3kg since the last weigh in and I’m gonna try and not weigh myself till sunday. I am going clubbing today (I’m not drinking tho) and I’m scared kinda how my body will react to it since it’s gotten so weak. But I’m also excited to just get out.

Reason to recover number twenty-gazillion: for all the soft, shiny curls. (Cause inadequate nutrition = sad hair, and that’s no fun.) 

Sobre ter pernas grossasEu odeio ser gorda. Odeio o fato de não poder usar vestido, saias ou coisa do tipo, se não eu fico toda assada. Isso é constrangedor e revoltante.

Even I don’t look like me. 
Those photos of fitness models? Posed. Good lighting. Flexed. 
I’m not a fitness model, but I have to remember that those models don’t have full time jobs and have time to do more than a half hour walk daily–they dedicate hours every day to work out. And that’s their job. And that’s okay. I’m not a fitness model. And that’s okay. 
Those relaxed photos are my body in its bloated after lunch glory. They’re the ones that freak my brain out. 
The top photos upset me because it’s a reminder of what I am and how far I have to go. 
The bottom photos upset me because we’re taught that the relaxed and wavy and bubbly and full body isn’t okay. And that’s stupid. 
I’m not where I want to be physically, or mentally, but I’m on the journey to learning to love myself. And that’s hard. And scary. But at least I’m on the journey. 

This is a really difficult question, and one that I am definitely not qualified to answer, but here’s my attempt at giving advice anyway.First, it would be important to learn their general views about eds, and other mental illnesses. Do they think lowly of sufferers? Do they treat mentally ill people differently just because of their illness? Are they one of those people that think depression can be cured by yoga and ana by eating a ‘burger?Ensuring that you know the answers to most of these questions, will help you determine your course of action. If they seem hostile towards sufferers, it’s honestly best to try not to bother with them, and look for another person to help you with your situation. This is kind of similar to the advice given to people wanting to come out as lgbtq+, and I think you can find some great tips about finding out the person’s views in articles and guides written about that. Just apply it to mental illnesses.   (Some articles either about coming out, or getting  mental help: 1 2 3 4 5 6)Once you have determined that your secrets are safe with the person and that they won’t react overly negatively, it’s time to have the talk. Prepare yourself for it, and come up with answers to possible questions beforehand. Like “how do you know?”, “how long have you been struggling?”. Consider that they won’t know what words/questions are sensitive, they might ask you dreaded questions like “how are you not underweight/how can you be ill and so big?” and others like it (even if you are underweight, them asking about your weight is sure to make anyone with an ed uncomfortable). Don’t hold this to them, and try to remain calm, but tell them that the language they used is distressing to you. Before you start the conversation, you also have to ask yourself: what exactly do you want to get out this? Do you just want to tell your problems to someone, or is this a first step in getting professional help? How will them knowing impact your living situation? Do you want anything to change? Be clear about your intentions while confronting them. If you want treatment, tell them, and explain your reasons why. If you don’t want treatment, do the same. This is another point where doing research, and forming arguments beforehand is critical - don’t let yourself be swayed from what you have previously determined as best for you right now after talking to another person once, but be open to their advice and suggestions. Disagree respectfully if needed. Offer them links, or sites where they can do their own research about the topic as well, but reaffirm them that you are open to answer their questions. If the conversation becomes too much for you, be sure to tell them! If they care about you, they will probably let you leave this situation that is clearly making you uncomfortable and leaving them a list of links can help in this scenario as well, by letting them do something in the meantime, that will make them feel like they are helping you. 

Here are some more articles that might help you research this topic, and come up with some answers to common questions.

I WENT TO THE MOVIES AND ATE FOOD AND DIDNT MAKE MYSELF SICK AND IM SO AMAZED AND PROUD AND OMG GUYS THIS IS SUCH A HUGE STEPPING STONE 

Answered a very similar question here!(additional resources:wikihow to tell your boyfriend you have an ed, forum answers and stories, help for boyfie to be an ally) 

AAAAAAAAAAHHHI DONT WANNA RECOVER!!!  I JUST WANNA BE SKINNY!!!  I MISS BEING ABLE TO LIKE MYSELF!!! 

today i was telling my dad all the things he needed to do to take care of my hamster while i’ll be gone, and i said “don’t forget to take good care of my baby!”he responded with “but you don’t take care of my baby: you”please, recover. do it for your dad. your mom. your family, friends, significant other. your pets. never let your parents be this sad.  

Listen up ladies and gents. I’ve seen a lot of posts recently from people struggling with being a higher weight because not only do you have to come to terms with the physical changes to your body, but there is a huge, sudden deluge of mental and emotional pain to cope with. But please understand, this pain is not a result of weight gain. It will not go away if you relapse. The pain was always there - it is the reason your eating disorder or coping mechanisms came about in the first place. And it will always be there, no matter how long or hard you try to push it away or cover it up by using your eating disorder, it will follow you. Implacable, undeniable, persistent. Until you face it, do the work to address it, understand it, work through it, make peace with it. This is what recovery really is - not going through the motions of weight restoration and maintaining a strictly controlled minimally healthy weight. But going back to the source of the problem and loosening it’s power over you so that you no longer feel that desperate longing to be thin and in control. Stop spending every waking minute insulting and despising your healthier body and attempting to manipulate it to conform to your impossible standards. Instead accept that these feelings are an inevitable part of your journey. You will not move forward until you can let them go and focus on the bigger picture.

Gained a lot, but it feels ok currently. Wore this look for a party a couple of days ago & I felt great! Hope all of you are doing fine xx  

I vividly remember a therapists question to me during an intake assessment for my eating disorder. She asked me if I was in recovery or if I was still in the weight restoration phase. I paused to think about that for a moment because I had never separated the 2. In past recovery attempts my mind had equated weight restoration with recovery…one in the same! But, as I soon discovered, I needed to tend to my low body weight before I could retain the cognitive functioning needed to dig into the therapy work. It wasn’t as though I could do the “heavy mental lifting” when I was still below my set point weight. I had wanted recovery to be so quick and simple. Restore the weight…BAM! Done! But in reality there are multiple stages one goes through in recovery from an eating disorder, weight restoration is just the first step. Please remember this if you are in the process of healing your body physically. The weight gain is step one, you still have a long way to go. Use that as motivation to follow your meal plan and allow your body the rest and nourishment it needs. Please remember this if you are weight restored and think that recovery is over. Or if you are weight restored and worried about seeking help because you are no longer at your low point. Mental recovery really only begins once you are healthy physically. There is a long road ahead and you have the right to get help with each stage of this journey. Remember…You are never too far along for help.Recovery doesn’t just end once you are weight restored. Recovery is a multiple stage journey. Remission is not an end state.  

Today I did a thing. 
I went to the nude beach and made myself sit with my body completely sober and appreciate it. 
(I started drinking after 30 mins but I made myself appreciate my body first)
It was hard. It was challenging. 
I had a lot of intrusive thoughts.
I also had a lot of positive thoughts. 
I apologized to my body for years of abuse. 
I let my body know it’s not at fault for the abuse I didn’t cause. 
I made steps towards making peace with myself. 
I am determined to continue making peace with myself.

                I lost time, and I am gaining it back. 


Hey if u ate today, I’m proud of you, you kept it in???? Fucking amazing , you’re doing so good. Had a bad day??? Fucked up a bit?? It’s okay! Let yourself eat and be comfortable. You need it.  

Have you ever felt like crying would make you feel better but you feel so disconnected and tired that you dont even feel like doing that? …just what I feel atm… 


                — 
                except you can, you could say no to being the bridesmaid at the wedding because you can’t eat at the buffet and the thought of eating a slice of the cake sends shivers down your spine, you don’t have to go on the date to the fancy restaurant with the one you think you’ve been falling for for a whilte now because you don’t know how much oil the chef might use and ‘what if they want to order starters or dessert, too?’, you don’t have to try a bite (or a dozen) of the that you decided to bake and maybe you don’t think the spoon needs licking anyway, go home insead of heading out for drinks with the rest of your colleagues after work, watch from the end of the table as your family tuck in to their home made dinner. You can eat earlier, later, in the bathroom, or on the way home, in private, by your rules, with your say so. You don’t need to have that food, so you won’t. It’s okay, you feel fine, you didn’t want it anyway. You don’t need to do those things like everybody else, having ‘control’ is more important. So yes, you can live your life avoiding food and eating and drinking without meticulous planning for hours or days beforehand, but living your life doing just that, is pretty much all you’ll do.            


Seriously, though. If any of my people in recovery are thinking about relapsing today, just know that Donald Trump is already the most smug, arrogant person on the face of the planet. He doesn’t need another victory. YOU have control over your actions, no matter how scared you are, and using maladaptive coping mechanisms will not change anything that has happened. Fight. Be here so your voice can be heard. Do not throw away your chance to create change. I am always here to talk.

I checked the scale again, (I know I shouldn’t have), and I’ve gained a bit of weight which I know mostly has to be water weight but it still stresses me out extremely. My mind is telling me to not eat tomorrow or wait until later when I’m at work so I’ll only eat once, but I wont do that. I need to do better, and I cant let this ruin the progress I’ve been making. I use the thought that I need to be better for my boyfriend a lot, but I also just need to be better for myself. Itll be hard, but I’ll keep going 🖤 

my sister: are you hungry?me, downing my green tea with vinegar, sucking on a cigarette while wearing five layers of clothes to keep myself warm: no, thank you for asking though!! :) 

Hola. I’m here again.
Ieri sera ho guardato Avengers: The Age of Ultron. Sto cercando di recuperarmi tutta la saga, dato che con l’uscita di Endgame sono stata circondata da persone che parlavano di cose di cui so praticamente niente (certo, la stessa cosa accade adesso con Game of Thrones, ma diciamo che otto stagioni sono un po’ troppo lunghine da recuperare E sono ancora in fissa con il mio principio “prima leggerò i libri”) (il che vuol dire che la serie di GoT non la vedrò mai, visto come non sto procedendo nella lettura).
Per molti anni sono stata tagliata veramente fuori dalla vita, persino dalle cose banali come film in uscita. “Sono stata tagliata fuori dalla vita” aka “mi sono tagliata fuori dalla vita” aka “la mia malattia mi ha tagliata fuori dalla vita”. Ancora su molte cose sono come una bambina. Certo, ho vissuto realtà sulla mia pelle che poche persone possono “vantarsi” di aver toccato (per quanto uno invece dovrebbe ringraziare il cielo che non sia capitato a lui), e sì, non tornerei indietro.
Non ho intenzione di mentire su questo. Non cancellerei il mio dca dal mio passato, non tornerei indietro per schiaffeggiare la mia me di sei anni e passa fa per dirle “ma che cazzo fai?”. La mia vita è stata una merda, ma so che se non fosse subentrato il dca ci sarebbe stato qualcos’altro. Forse le droghe, visto il tipo di persone alle quali stavo avvicinandomi. Non parlo di droghe pesanti eh, ma comunque qualcosa che non mi avrebbe portata a situazioni molto migliori di quella attuale. Forse sarebbe finita prima, forse sarebbe finita in modo diverso, forse sarei stata solo in un centro di riabilitazione o forse mi sarei bruciata totalmente la testa.
La verità è che, quando si sta davvero male (qualunque il motivo sia), un modo per scappare si cerca sempre. E spesso questi modi sono autodistruttivi. Si spera che ci diano salvezza, che ci diano uno scopo, che ci rendano qualcuno… e per un po’ è vero. Ma cosa può portarti di buono un’etichetta come “drogata”, “autolesionista”, “anoressica”? E non intendo a livello sociale, di quello che pensano gli altri, ma intendo SU DI TE.

It surely does not 💕🤗💕💪🏼💕 and you’re not alone in this!!! 

HI, MY NAME IS _______ AND I HAVE BULIMIA.I’m so damn tired of
 feeling ashamed of having bulimia rather than Anorexia, it’s such a 
stigmatized illness–I mean no body wants to talk about puking but hey, 
it’s something I have struggled with for years and years and I AM NOT 
ASHAMED ANYMORE. Reblog this to spread awareness that bulimia is just as
 serious as Anorexia and deserves more recognition and support!!! Add 
your own personal stories of bulimia recovery or struggle, their NEEDS 
to be more awareness and less shame and secrecy.  

Positive update:
Things are getting better with each passing day. I’m able to walk and my bloods, kidney function and now liver function are all coming back as normal. I’m still in abdominal pain each day but the intensity is lessening and it is more manageable. I’ve had 3 nasogastric tubes so far this admission and my feeds are slowly increasing to their goal rate. The nausea is less, and parts of my body that weren’t working as effectively as they are meant to are now improving. I’m spending a lot of time reading which is so relaxing and am fortunate to have visitors every day. Things are improving ☺️ 

July 15th recap. So, long-story-short, I binged at the end of the night, but there is some good that came out of this binge.🌭 It solidified my theory that if I go too long without a meal, I will inevitably get the urge to binge. This also solidifies my theory that making sure to eat every three hours or so will help keep those urges away (or at least deintensify them). 🍔 This was my first binge in OVER a month. This means I’ve successfully cut my binges down from once a week, to once a month. I am very proud of that.🍭 I found that journaling has seriously helped my post-binge anxiety and has cut the time I have said anxiety in half. Journaling has helped me recover from this binge a lot faster.🍦 I found out that talking out my feelings after a binge is way more beneficial than I previously considered. Talking it out with my dear friend @fatmaninalittlesuit really helped out with my post-binge anxiety. ❤️🌻 I took the time to be super mindful after my binge. I actually took the initiative to utilize coping mechanisms to soothe my mind, body, and soul. As cheesy as it may sound, I feel that this binge greatly contributed to some personal growth. :)  

Started off the day with two eggs with cheese (250cals). Eventually I’ll try not counting calories, but I’m already making a stride by eating this many calories so early in the day. The cheese in itself was 110 calories, and when I counted that up, it honestly made me feel really sick. But that’s what I need to fight. So I ate it anyways, and I feel really full right now, but that’s okay. This is just giving me energy for the day, and it tasted really good too. I want to get back to enjoying the food I eat. I’ll do my best at lunch time, and then see what I can do for dinner 🖤 

 

When you’re not sure if you’re genuinely improving because you’re getting things done or if you’re just experiencing mania and going to crash down at any given second 🙃  



A lil sunburn and a lil acne but we’re thriving in this beautiful weather 🌼 feeling really good and confident today!   

Make it stop.  

Why yes fellow nutrition-consumers this menu does look quite delicious and not at all terrifying; what food items are you all considering ordering in a totally normal non-panicked food ordering way?  I personally am very eager for and not screaming inside about these large portions, and I am utterly unfazed by the caloric information written next to each entre nope that doesn’t make me want to run for the hills at all :) I am so excited for this wow 

Surviving off fruit and coffee at the moment fml 







Mann today is weird. It’s my last day as an undergraduate. It was my last day at the boys and girls club. 
Today I felt like a Viking with my hairstyle. Today I walked to the gym, ran on the elliptical, went to yoga, walked back, went to work, and  now I’m off to celebrate finishing school with friends. 
Today I am freaking afraid of eating at a restaurant. Today I also know that as a womb-haver I will always have a pouch of fat on my tummy. And cellulite on my legs and arms. And it’s okay that I’m not okay with it. 
I don’t have to like my body to respect it. 
And is a lot going on? Yes. 
My summer housing plans maybe fell through and I may have to be in my car for a few days. Or sleeping at my dad’s work. 
I’m looking for day jobs preferable working with kids so I’d you’re in Denver and know where is hiring hit me up. 
I’m in two summer hiking shows so if you’re in boulder and want to see funny kid-friendly shows hit me up too. 
I’m broke, I’m sad, I’m sentimental, but that’s okay. 
Recovery is fucking hard because I still want to lose weight, but have stopped using a scale, so it’s a weird mind fuck.  

I was reborn 5 springs ago. April 2011 is when I entered treatment for bulimia and began the journey of becoming myself. At the time, I didn’t really know that my life would change so drastically. I honestly didn’t believe that I would be alive for very much longer because I had given up… fortunately for me, the people in my life hadn’t.Recovery is the hardest thing that I have ever done and continue to do, but the rewards have been immeasurable. As I’ve shared recently, I still struggle all the time with so many things. But the difference is that now I face my challenges openly and honestly and without shame, as the woman that I have always wanted to be. If you are struggling with an eating disorder (whether you have began recovery or not) please don’t give up on yourself. You are important. You are not alone. Your struggle is not shameful, it is human and therefore beautiful. You are worthy of acceptance and love from everyone and most importantly from yourself… And I pray that you find your spring. 🌷xxAmina 

You know you’ve properly become healthy when you start craving lettuce  

 

You don’t have to relapse to validate your pain. 

Trying to explain ED logic (e.g. “You’re a failure because you had breakfast today”) to my friends and family, and realizing how little sense it makes 

Me when I go against my therapists’ advice and end up more mentally unstable than I was in the first place
 

For me eating carbs is too difficult rn, i will eat more fish, meat and eggs(and fruit and vegetables).It’s even better than not eating at all….right? 

bulimia recovery day 7 ! im gaining weight and thats okay , im actually eating and not starving, i could cry right now im so grateful, my headaches have gone away and the bruising on my knuckles are fading, i still feel anxious about my body but i know that i need to do this, im less tired than ive usually been, and best of all, i dont have to lie!!! you have no idea how good that feels. im so grateful. 



Me: today was a great day I graduated and because I’m sore from yesterday im allowed to rest. 
Also me:lol you gotta be better than  you yesterday,  the only person you should compete with is you, and you have a big goal to exceed. 
Also also me: but it’s the new moon and I’m sore. 
Also also also me: bitch 
Anyway eating disorder recovery is hard as fuck and I just see my lack of progress and it fucks me up. I literally went to the gym and had no energy, I ended up sitting in the sauna and going home but feeling guilty and gross at home I walked 5 miles and now it all hurts more and wow I’m a perfectionist and I realize I set impossible goals because I feel like if I meet a goal that means the goal wasn’t hard enough but damn  

Okay soI have 2 months and 22 days to lose 10kg/22lbs or even more if possible. Now, this is very important, and literally crucial for my life. My birthday is on the 21st July, and also my sister is marrying in that exact same day. There will be so many relatives, and professional photographers, and also so many people with cameras, and since I’m the maid of honour, I’ll basically be everywhere where my sister is. I need to lose more than 10kg/22lbs so I can at least look decent. We will remember this day throughout our lives, and I don’t want to be the only fat girl. Please if you see this, don’t scroll down, and comment some tips, even if you’re new to this, comment something inspirational. Thank you 💖 

im so over these corny recovery instagram accounts who post loads of weight gain before and after posts (even though theyre still very slim and conventional by society’s standards) and start every caption with “LETS TALK ABOUT CALORIE COUNTING ⬇️” or “dear body, im sorry for what ive done to you” or “You see that girl on the left? doesnt she look happy? well, she wasnt.” and continue to post about their macros/specific diets for “gut health”/ exercise routines ……..  

It’s sad. At one point in my life, I would’ve killed to have the body I have right now. Even the body that I hate so much because I’m bloated. Even the body that looks too big because I drank so much water. I would have killed to see my hip bones even a bit. I would have killed to be able to see my ribs when I sucked in. Now, I’m looking in the mirror. In my swimsuit. Having cried because I ate 200 calories in salt and vinegar chips because I was advised to by a medical professional. I’m drowning myself in Coke Zero and water. My collar bones stick out. My wrists are boney, pale, and covered in bruises. My hip bones protrude and when I lift up my sweater, I can see all of my ribs. The sweater I bought almost 4 years ago that is now way too big on me. And I’m not happy with it. It isn’t enough. I’m not thin enough. I will never. Be. Thin. Enough. My UGW is a BMI so low that I will be dead or at least hospitalized before I reach it. 30 more pounds. That’s all I need. I would have killed to have a BMI of 17.7 but all I want is one of 12.5. I am so sorry to the 14 year old girl who weighed 129lbs and thought she wasn’t enough. I’m so sorry that your goal wasn’t enough. I’m so sorry that you’re never going to grow up because of this. I’m sorry that I’m doing this to you. When will I be enough for myself? 

 

When my dietitian gives me my first meal plan (TW: Restricting)Dietitian: *hands me paper outlining meal plan*Me/ED Voice: *scans meal plan* Okay okay so this is good let’s put a pin in this…but hey how about instead I just live off of tea and popcorn like, forever?  

DUDE I don’t want to say that your parents are awful, but they sound absolutely AWFUL and totally un-supportive. I can totally see how telling them would be a bad idea. I highly suggest that you reach out to advisers at NEDA for help, because I’m by no means a medical professional. I do empathize with you though <3 I’m so sorry this is such a hard time for you. Hang in there. 

things no one talks about when it comes to eds-you’re not going to feel happy at your goal weight. if anything you’ll feel worse. that goal weight number will only decrease and decrease. you will never be satisfied. -your anxiety levels skyrocket. you will feel a pain in your chest every single time meal times come up, every lunch break at school comes up, every time you walk into your kitchen, every time you see food on your dashboard. -you’ll start to notice changes in your body sure, but they’ll never, ever, ever be good enough. a year ago i dreamed about having a thigh gap. now i have one and it makes me want to cry every time i look at myself because its not small enough. you’ll never be happy with yourself while you have this disorder.-you unconsciously distance yourself from people. you don’t want to go see a movie with friends because there are too many snacks around. you don’t want to go to a family dinner because theres too much food. you don’t want to go to school because there’s a large lunch break. you don’t want to go out anymore, because food is everywhere.-your “safe” foods will no longer feel safe. that 50 calorie muesli bar suddenly feels like too much. that small 30 calorie coffee will make you feel guilty.-people close to you will notice. it feels like they don’t but they do. your mum notices that your jeans have become baggier. your dad notices that you don’t eat when he cooks. your siblings notice that you don’t have any energy to play with them anymore. your friends notice you don’t eat during lunch breaks or when you guys go out. your grandparents notice when you refuse a cupcake or cookie. people notice, and they worry. your eating disorder has one job. to make you unwell, and stay unwell. if you are even pondering the idea that you may have an eating problem or a body image issue, get help. talk to someone. you are sick enough. you deserve to get help. you deserve treatment. dont let “thinspo” and “proana” tumblr destroy you. 

Oatmeal is the absolutely best thin in the world.  

fuck my life. I don’t know what to do with myself. i mean i have a recovery app on my phone. i made my own meal plan (i am waiting for a reference to a psych). but yeah…. i just cant seem to stick with it. i am trying. everything hurts right now. my back is fucking killing me lately. it hurts more at night. i don’t know what to do. i just want to feel better. i feel so hopeless right now. i hate this. i fucking hate this. i hate this time of year. it is around the time my sexual abuse was the worst. my body remembers and i am not really doing okay… 

I broke some some ed rules today and didn’t measure my oats, almond milk or the amount of peanut butter 😋 
I always convinced myself that measuring my oats etc. for these jars was just to get the proportions right but honestly, it tastes good no matter what the oat/milk ratio is and the more PB the better 🙈 
Wishing you all a happy Friday and a great weekend! Can’t wait to update you guys after the race tomorrow. I’m having a ton of carbs tonight - pasta, bread and a salad for dinner to get my energy intake up!  

This snow and sleet is making me feel good again. The crummy weather keeps my eating disorder thoughts at bay. It’s far too snowy to ride miles and miles on my bike. Tonight, you get to rest. Because that’s what your body (and the weather) says. 

Honestly? I’ve been doing so well recently, ED recovery wise. My most recent dietitian appointment at the clinic went very well, and she was really impressed by me and the process I’ve made through the year I’ve been treated there. It just makes me so happy that despite the fact I’m perhaps gonna have to deal with it for the rest of my life, I do manage the disordered part of my brain rather well and damn it, I am really damn proud of myself for that. Screw this,  I’ve actually said that - I’m proud of myself and at the long process of recovery I’ve made. I never thought I could say that. And for anyone who’s struggling - there is always hope. It’s difficult, I’m not gonna lie to anyone - it is difficult and it takes time - but damn it, getting better feels so wonderfully good and it’s just worth all of the hard work and suffering on the way. You all can reblog this, fellas, I want the message of recovery is possible to be spread on. You can do that, lovelies, I believe in you.  

You ever think that you’re not sick enough to get treatment for your ED? Yeah, so does pretty much E V E R Y O N E who’s ever had an eating disorder. You deserve help, please get it any way you can. 

Being in recovery from multiple addictions is a lot like one of those wack-a-mole games at the arcade. It feels like the second you’ve got one down, another one pops up. The thing though that I’ve failed to realize until now is that at some point you’ll be able to look down and notice that you don’t have to keep playing. I think those games are hacked. In a sense, the very reason those other moles are popping up is because you’ve got one of them under. I’ve got to stop holding onto one addiction and pretending I’m fine. I know my life will get a whole lot better when I surrender to this cyclical game. When I damn stop attempting to constantly keep up, and just let myself be free of all the addictions keeping me hostage. I need to stop trying to be in control, and in giving up that control—I’m actually winning. Sometimes Surrendering Actually Means You Win  

On June 1st, I’ll be 6 months clean from bulimia. It really does get easier. Hang in there. 

After multiple abusive exes I finally have someone who makes me feel beautiful, now I love my body because I learned to see myself through his eyes 



Normal person, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                Ah yes indeed that was quite tasty.                    

Me, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                DID Y'ALL JUST SEE THAT AMAZING FEAT I JUST PULLED? I DESERVE A METAL. I AM A FUCKING WARRIOR GODDESS. I AM LITERALLY THE MOST BADASS PERSON WHO EVER LIVED.                    





me with an ED:
                                                i could just like delete this meal within the next 30 minutes and it'd be like it never happened.                    

me with ED but an hour later:
                                                *hasn't purged* is this r e c o v e r y? or l a z i n e s s?                    



I forgot to mention that on March 7th I celebrated 2 years binge/purge free!! That is 730 days!! I rock and so do you!! Fuck eating disorders!! 

Reminder Please don’t post before and after pics! These can be extremely triggering and there are better ways to raise awareness!  

It really feels like spring today, which is weird because it’s supposed to snow Wednesday. I’m digging the floral witchy vibe. 
 it’s really hard to post selfies and love myself in them, but I’m working on writing my narrative to exclude the self-hate stories I’ve written for my self. 
I may have relapsed this weekend. I may have had moments of fear and panic, but just like a flower will grow despite what others think of it, so will I. 
Exciting project coming up this weekend, be ready for a full photo set.  

you hear the phrase “you’re not your mental illness” so often and I only recently really realised what it means
like… sometimes you’ve been living with your illness so long that you decided it’s just a part of you and your personality and your identity, and it makes you scared to recover because you think that you’ll lose that particular sense of self that you’ve built up over time
so I’m just here to remind you that recovery is worth it because it’s not losing yourself, it’s finding the real you that isn’t buried beneath the self destructiveness and apathy and fatigue that your mental illness gave you and I’m on my way there and it’s honestly the best, and it’s possible for anyone so don’t give up 

The only thing in my recommended on youtube is ED recovery videos, ghost hunting videos and Shane Dawson compilations and I think that perfectly describes my personality  

I saw (another) new therapist yesterday.  Asically my last resort for eating disorder therapists in my town. It went wel. She was honest with me and said she doesn’t have too much background in treating eating disorders, but we agreed that if she feels things with my eating disorder are getting too out of control for that therapy setting, then she will have to refer me back to the Eating Disorder Institute. I agreed with that plan. However, I feel like I already need to be going to the EDI. I’ve relapsed. This weather makes me feel like I NEED to be outside on my bike enjoying the sunshine. I get carried away. I’m hoping my new therapist can help me with my anxiety and OCD and in turn that will help with my eating disorder. I hope. 

my period has made me eat more no surprise!!…I’m gonna start skipping lunch and replacing it w/ fruit and caffeine to lose the weight I’ve gained when it’s over.In other news I ran a 5K today woo!! No clue how much it burned but i’m proud I did it anyway :) Gonna do another one next weekStay safe <3 

This ED makes me thank the heavens above that I’m good at maths…. 

Anyone else LOVE watching baking and cooking videos to try and ease the cravings cause they can’t make the food for themselves? 

I can’t believe I’m posting this but here is my body appreciation post. For the past four years I’ve struggled with an eating disorder as well as depression/anxiety and it’s been one of the hardest most painful things I’ve ever struggled with. For so long I hid it from everyone, for so long I told everyone I was ‘recovered’, for so long I thought I could live with it. You see, I wasn’t living at all–I was barely surviving. I’ve spent years wasting my time restricting, purging, and obsessing over food and I am so fucking done. For the past four months I’ve been in and out of Renfrew Residential and Partial treatment facility and it has honestly changed my life. For the first time in forever I am learning to accept my body the way it is. I am learning that what I say matters and that I can’t run away from the pain anymore; I need to embrace it. Please, if you are ever struggling with disordered eating message me or tell someone you trust. You deserve recovery. You deserve to live–just as I deserve to live. 

Wishing you all a very happy Easter from me and lil ginger 🦊🌼
Like many other holidays, society demonizes all of the treats associated with them. 
This is just a reminder that Easter candy is nostalgic, yummy, meant to be enjoyed, and won’t make you gain ten pounds! 
I hope to those who are celebrating today, that they can find the courage to challenge what diet culture, your ED, and that silly relative who’s always on a diet is telling you about holiday food. It’s just one day! Please enjoy it!! 
I know I’ll be eating my chocolate Reese bunny today 🙈 no regrets and shame over here 👋🏼 

repeat after me: What my body needs is different from what other people need. That doesn’t mean what I am eating is wrong. Comparing to others is pointless.  

My muscles are so sore from working out that I can’t even walk properly anymore. Do any of you have some tips for soothing sore muscles? How long will this take to heal? It’s been three days and nothing has changed sjejejwk 

How crazy it is that eating regular meals each day leaves me feeling more body positive than starvation ever did.. 

My therapist asked me where I see myself in 10 years and where I see my ED in ten years. It hit me so hard because tbh in 10/15 years I see myself eighter recovered or dead. This might sound super ridiculous but I know I won’t get through a lifetime with an ed. I don’t want that. And it made me so sad to realize that sometimes I’d rather be miserable and kill myself than to recover. That I’m throwing away my dreams for an addiction.This might sound really dramatic but this is just how I feel and it hurts like hell.  

Realized Ive been recovered for six months 

why can’t my relationship with food just be normal 😞 

Just had such a stressful experience in the supermarket with my dad. Had it in my head that I’d have soup for dinner but he made me buy in his words a “proper meal”. I can’t do this right now and I’m seriously going to have to think of a way to try and avoid eating it or eat as little as I possibly can. Actually fml

I conquered last night like the queen I am! 
I got two different style wings and fries AND had some onion rings + loaded tater tots for an appetizer. No, I didn’t finish alllll the food but I ate til I was content. I ordered exactly what I wanted. I ordered a freaking wing platter when my ed would usually have convinced me to have a salad or something “clean” and “healthy”. Yes, I had ed thoughts but I didn’t let that translate into behaviors 👊🏼 i know this isn’t good, but I woke up and weighed myself this morning and was down three pounds from the day before even though I felt bloated and heavier, the number went down. This goes to show that you can’t trust the number on the scale, and that the number really doesn’t matter. I really need to break my weighing habit. 
this morning, I went for a workout with my aunts, and then to brunch! I had an egg thingy on a brioche bun, a side of bacon and potatoes, a bite of a pancake AND a quarter of a Belgian waffle with maple syrup 🙈 I didn’t have to earn my food this morning. I didn’t have to make up for eating last night. I simply had a bit of everything and enjoyed myself to the fullest. 
 

These 24h was a blessing in terms of little work - was able to read and sleep even. The morning staff who I’ve passed the shift on to were celebrating bday so sat and drank with them a little (homemade alco - so good as usual) and ate some pie. Now I’ve stopped for a coffee bc need to hide from the rain and I’m having classes in an hour. 







Top 9 selfies of 2018! Literally no one tagged me (lol what a loser), but one of my goals this year was to be ok with pictures of myself. I’m trying! Anyway…it me. 
I tag @transdimensional-void @yikesola @mgwannabe @supergirltumbls @knlalla @watergator  

Trigger warning - eating disorder mentionSinging was and is still one of my favourite things to do but because of all of the damage I’ve caused to my throat over years of suffering through bulimia my throat gets soooo inflamed every time I do sing 😔 it’s a cruel reminder of the crap I’ve gone through and am still going through… Recovery is hard  

Leaving out the pay check on the table was actually a great thing i did bc accidentally glancing at it gives me somewhat a reason to wake up tomorrow lol.It was the only good thing that happened today.I headed out to buy friend a gift after the shift and i’m not quite satisfied with what i’ve picked, don’t know if she’ll be happy will see tomorrow. Binged, purged then slept for 3 hours, was woken up by a cat, got up, made some coffee, texted people, got no reply, read a book. 

Eating Disorder Confession #2 I get very upset anytime I actually get my period cause it means I’ve put on enough weight for it to happen  

I go home from the recovery program. I know I’ve gained. I’m already obsessing about hopping on the scales after taking twenty laxetives and how it will make me cry because I’m so fat.I cant deal with recovery. Recovery is too scary. I’m going to fast as long as I can and make sure I keep doing so until I’m skinny. I’m already planning what I want to binge on to break that fast just so I can purge it. I’m not recovered. I’m far from it. 

 

I think of what I did to myself during those years…  this shit is so fucking twisted 

Relapse: I had a bad relapse… I threw up everything I ate yesterday, including breakfast today. I don’t know where my life is currently heading, but I know it is on a dark and dangerous path, I’m so frustrated with myself, and annoyed and just worried! I can’t fucking do this, but I know I need to but I just can’t deal with the stress and anger of constantly failing! Please! Someone give me advice I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be like this anymore!  

Guess who talked about bulimia and my severe fatigue at the doctor’s office today??? This chick hell yeah 

Hello lovelies! Today I am talking about extreme hunger. I share my personal experience with this, explain what it is, why it happens, and how to make it stop. Hope you enjoy! xx 

Right now your eating disorder may feel like home But I promise you  Home is not meant to be a place that destroys you  Home is a place that builds you up  A place that makes you feel whole  Build a life for yourself  And your home will be all around you  Let your home be in the arms of a loved one  In your job In your friends In your passions In your smile and laughter Build a life for yourself One that’s congruent to who YOU are without this illness  And I promise  You will finally feel at home 

Tears, tears & more tears.Everything is just going so wrong today. I am 100% trying to live a healthy lifestyle and fight this but today i just don’t have the energy or the strength. We had a huge storm today which lead basically my entire town into a blackout. We all got sent home from work early after calling all the kid’s parents(I’m a preschool teacher) and that just threw off my entire day. 😩I’ve been applying for jobs all night and getting no where because i’ve been stuck on trying to write the perfect cover and i’m just failing at it… On top of this my face is oily and breaking out and i honestly just feel like crap that i’m having such a hard time at looking at myself im the mirror.Overall today is a really nad body image day mixed with a little bit of anxiety and depression and i just can’t wait for it to be over 🙄 I really hope everyone else had an amazing day💞rant over … 

Hugging people with chub is so nice?? Like??? They’re so warm and squishy???? I love them??? Also? People with no chub are super fun to hug too??? Like their tummies are tiny and you just want to wrap your arms around them twice???? 
All tummies are cute 

i just want eatingwithout feeling that i’m a terrible person without feeling sadwithout wanna diei just want eat i just want be happiei just want walk in the nature and think about the trees not about how much i weight 

Hi I’m blonde now 💁🏼‍♀️
 

It’s almost the last day of eating disorder awareness week and I just want to remind everyone there is no way to live with an eating disorder- You will die of malnourishment or suicide unless you recover. There’s no exceptions. And everyone who supports “pro-ana” “pro-mia” or “thinspo” is responsible for spreading this disease to others and has blood on their hands. You need to know this 

relapse urges to high heaven this morning but that never made me happy!! im gonna take care of my body bc it’s the only one i’ve got!!! 

Any advice? (Ptw)I keep coughing so hard I throw up. Like I promise it’s unintentional, but it’s happening a lot. And I feel nauseous and not hungry most of the time. But I feel like I’m not trying to restrict or lose weight? It’s just like the physical symptoms. My doctor says it’s my asthma but I’m so so worried it’s the start of gastroparesis or something like that. 

4th February 2017I always presumed wrongfully that I was recovered when I was in fact so far from it. When I stopped throwing up my food in my late teens, I assumed I had overcome bulimia, only to realise I had just jumped the fence straight into the arms of anorexia. When I moved overseas, claiming I was better, I found myself on my knees at the mercy of the toilet bowl in my European apartment, promising myself this was the last time. On my return home, crippled by an injury, I convinced myself that I could lose weight and stop eating because I did not need to fuel myself to exercise. I dodged a hospitalisation by a kilogram because “I was fine. I was recovering.” All these times I thought that I was recovered. That this was the best it would be. That I would teeter on the edge of sick and well and choose well most of the time. But let me tell you, I know now what recovery is. It’s eating a pizza, drinking cocktails and going skinny dipping in the ocean because you are not afraid of yourself anymore. It’s going on dates and allowing yourself to feel sexy in the presence of another human being. It’s walking past an unhealthy girl and not feeling envious, but instead feeling pity and sadness for that poor girl.  It’s not posting daily on Tumblr, Instagram or Facebook with updates of your recovery, intake and body weight because those things could not be further from your mind. This is recovery. And let me tell you, it feels amazing.  

I don’t want to be sick anymore… 

Originally posted by gracefuldreamerHello dearest readers!😁 I completely realize that I have vanished (almost) without a trace for a good few months now and I feel terrible about BUT there are a few not so tiny reasons for it:💔 I ended a 3+ year relationship with my fiancee about 5 months ago and moved out into a new place with my brother and his girlfriend. This has been quite the wild ride and definitely something I was sure would be the end of the world for me BUT what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger and I’ll write a whole post just on this later (if any of you are interested to find out how that all went down and how I dealt with the fallout without snapping or falling apart.)
🎊 I got promoted twice at work which meant - you guessed it - TWICE the work! So ramping up with that (and it’s a pseudo-management role) has definitely taken it’s mental toll on me and tossed my sleep schedules way off whack. Lack of sleep = lack of motivation and energy for extracurricular things (like blogging) so thus the dry spell (pardon my French!)
🍎 I came to the realization that I’m actually in what ‘they’ (whoever THEY are) call “partial-recovery” and this is something I seriously needed to come to terms with in order to continue helping you lovely folks and giving advice that I myself was 100% taking. This is one that I’m STILL working through and I’ll write an in-depth post on Partial Recovery and where I’m at with that, what it means and how I’m re-planning my approach to not only my own recovery but to supporting all you warriors that brave struggles of your own every day. 
Hopefully, given that those are some pretty solid reasons for taking a brief (OK - not so brief) hiatus, you can forgive my lack of motivating posts and rest articles but I pledge to from this day forth (or the wrath of *insert worst super villain here* shall be bestowed upon me) that I will commit to not only answering your guys’ recovery questions once again but I’ll be following this posting schedule and coming out with new recovery articles weekly!🖊 MY NEW POSTING SCHEDULE 🖊 1 New Article / week: Posted to your delicious feeds (no pun intended) every Sunday at 9:30pm EST.1 New Inspiring Quote / week: Tossed atcha every Wednesday evening at 9:30pm EST1 Weekly photo-feed: Where I’ll share some fav snaps of my life / recovery practices etc every Saturday at 9:30 pm EST.I’m setting ⏰ 27 reminders ⏰ as we speak and I won’t disappear on you guys again! Anyways, hopefully you’re all doing amazingly great and practiced self-love and mindfulness over the holidays because that’s SO important. I know ED doesn’t make the holiday season easy so I hope you guys were able to make the best of it and get that annoying little voice to shut up for at least a ew minutes every day as you celebrated whatever it is that your family celebrates around this time of year. :)Cheers, happy weekend and hugs to all you guys!💋 XOX 💋K

                Internet comment            


I’m so ready to recover I’m so tired of being this way, I want to be normal and happy.  

Honestly being hospitalized and locked in the hospital for over a week and not being able to purge because everyone is watching what I eat, how much I eat, how much I drink and such is so nerve breaking…Thankfully I’ll be out by the end of this week, I can’t handle this anymore. 

I’m so happy right now, I won at a giveaway for a diet/training ebook and a fitness group subscription by literally my favorite instagram trainers ever!! I’m so hyped and I can’t wait to start, maybe I’ll get my summer body after all!! (trigger warning: eating disorders) I also feel like it’s a sign from the universe. I’ve been relapsing pretty badly the last couple of days and I’ve been feeling so hopeless because I seemed to gain weight whenever I tried to eat a normal balanced diet and I only lost weight when I threw up basically all the food I’ve been eating, which obviously made me feel weak, dizzy, and isn’t good for my health at all. Just yesterday I said “I’m giving up trying to recover, who cares if I feel like shit and ruin my health.” and I know this is exactly my chance to start fresh and try to form a normal relationship with food again ❤️ 

I’ve often thought my eating disorders were invalid, simply because they do aren’t incredibly severe to the point where I’m hospitalized for starvation or my teeth are falling out or I’m passing out every day (etc.). And because of this, it’s driven me to go harder on myself and starve myself more and purge more, and it’s ridiculous! Any eating disorder is enough of a danger to recover from. Any eating disorder is ‘sick enough’, it’s an unhealthy relationship with food and it’s best to stop it as soon as you can! 

Reason to live #3To recover fully and live my life🌼☁⛅ 

Sup bro dudes I’m two days binge/purge free and tonight will be three. Coolio. I’ve been feeling so fucking down lately and I don’t know why. I can’t make myself do anything productive or even leave my room. Don’t know why this is happening again 🙃 lol trying to pull myself out of it before I do some bad things I’ll regret lol I love depression lol 

I might lose my fiancé..This is it. He’s at his wits end with me and this ED. I’m gonna give it my all, I feel this is my last chance to keep him (you, if you’re reading this Alex). I can’t keep having this happen, I can’t keep losing control over this ED and I definitely can’t lose him. I know they say don’t change yourself for someone else, but in reality I’m  choosing to change my life because it includes that someone else…I can’t make promises but I can say I this is one of the worst feelings I’ve ever had, to hear the words “I feel like 10lbs means more to you than I do” breaks my heart, there’s so many ED voices in my head that try to stop my from truly feeling those words, they tell me: I’m losing weight for us, I can give you more of me when I like me, you never hit your goal weight there’s still hope you’ll be happy there, we’ll both like me more when I’m skinnier, etc.. It would be one of the hardest moments of my life if he were to leave me, I love this man and I wish I could love myself half as much as I love him, it’s hard so hard to say no to these things that I’ve honestly grown addicted to… (bingeing, purging, diet pills, body checking, etc…)Hopefully this time is enough for me to stay in recovery… if I don’t and if I lose him to this disease/condition/mental illness then I will accept that, I would’ve left too like everyone else. No matter what he’ll have my heart, my soul, my home and happy place..  

Feel like absolute shit today. Feel heavy and super tired. So I baked a big vegan chocolate cake for my family to enjoy to make myself feel better. I will not be eating it though as I’m not in the mental space for unhealthy, fattening foods right now 

Can anyone help me out?This is a long shot but could someone please tell me what they have for snacks throughout the day and evening? I’m really struggling. Hoping someone under the ed tags can help me out. 

Eating disorders fuck with your sense of right and wrong so much. 

personal…but….so like. why cant i learn to eat right? im wasting our money, torturing my body, and destroying my motivation. its a lose lose lose situation but i cant seem to stop the cycle.  

I can’t anymore. I just purged for the first time in 2 days.  Wtf, I’m such a disgusting piece of shit. Catch me not eating for 2 days.  Originally posted by ana-suicida 

New Video! Why you shouldn’t fear weight gain in ED recovery! <3 Hope you enjoy Xx 

TW for EDI’ve been prescribed new pain meds for my back and I’ve been instructed to take them four times a day with food. I don’t eat four meals a day. I barely eat two. I’m so busy or tired that I just don’t. I’ve started eating breakfast but it’s not a huge amount, then I won’t eat until dinner, aside from some snacks. I don’t like eating three meals a day. I know, given my past history, that this is disordered eating, but it’s what I’m comfortable with. I’m scared to eat three meals a day, let alone four! I have no idea what to do.  

Steps onto soapbox……just because you are in recovery does not make you a better person then someone who is not in recovery.That is all. 

Sorry I haven’t been on in awhile or posting as much I’ve been going through a really rough time. I hope things are okay for all of you. Keep your heads up and keep fighting! You got this! 

My eating disorderBefore I ever used drugs, I starved myself (ages 13-16). I had a different blog and closely followed the “pro ana” and “pro mia” communities (anorexia and bulimia). My cellphone background was a picture of Dr. Phil pointing at me, and it was labeled you’re fat. Don’t sugarcoat it, because you’ll eat that too. I followed a diet created by anorexics called the ABC diet: one day you eat 200 calories, the next day 300, maybe fast the following day, and eat 500 calories max on the fourth day. I was addicted to hearing my stomach growl and seeing the number on the scale plummet.When I started using drugs at the late age of 16, my eating disorder seemed to vanish. I still hated my body, but being able to control how I felt with substances shifted the direction of my addiction. I loathed what I saw in the mirror, but that didn’t really matter anymore because I was too high to care. At this time I also taught myself how to vomit on cue–if I overrate I would run straight to the toilet.Now that I’m clean I am throwing up a lot more, but not enough to raise concern. I know I have a problem, but the problem isn’t out of control and it isn’t too enormous. I probably throw up three times a week, and sometimes not at all. But my ED tendencies are still there and I’m afraid to confront it and tell anybody about it. I have no shame speaking about my heroin addiction, but when it comes to food I feel a little embarrassed.I wanted to write about this because I need to be honest with myself, and you guys. I don’t want anyone to think that my addiction has vanished, and that sobriety is “easy” for me – I’m still an addict, and my toxic behaviors are still present. I’m afraid that if I stop puking, I’ll just do something else to harm myself. 

My life is big. I don’t know how else to explain it. Right now, my biggest problems are how scary it is to be falling in love, and the stress of applying to Ph.D. programs, and healing my leg so I can run marathons. My biggest problems are not what I think about my body or about whether I can bring myself to eat all three meals and snacks today. And don’t get me wrong, it’s terrifying. There are moments every day where I miss the comfort of a hospital bed and everyone being worried about the sound of my heart slowing to a stop. But please, let me tell you, how beautiful this fear is. Because I can sit here at my desk and see the journal where, exactly a year ago, I wrote a note that I thought would be my last. I can see it, and I cannot stop smiling because I know that there is no way that I will ever be in that place again.Please don’t be afraid of being big. Please embrace every inch of wild that you have. I promise you, the fear will be beautiful one day.

So, what I have begun to realize is that your body dysmorphia is going to increasingly get worse if you don’t recover. here’s why…. you hate they way you look. you see a distorted image of yourself… but for example if you already are a healthy weight THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT ACCEPT YOUR BODY AND EAT HEALTHIER. It’s the cold hard truth. If you don’t work on recovery you will keep losing and losing and losing until you are dead. DEAD. SO PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT THINSPO right now. Throw that stupid shit away. Focus on recovery. Obviously that’s easier said then done but I wish the best for you. As always sending y’all lots of love, Ava.   

It’s spontaneously resigning to the idea that you are a lost cause, it’s letting the thoughts consume you, throwing you into a primal frenzy disconnected from reality, as the true you retreats into some comfortable void in your mind. Quiet, comfortable, unseen, and, therefore, protected. Safe. My binge draws to a close and my universe is still. Then slowly a buzz turns into a roar, and my whole body begins to convulse.There is poison inside of me, my mind reels, I have poison inside of me that I have to get out or else the poison will eat me alive. The poison will consume me and will become true.There is a poison inside me, and I have to get it out. My survival instincts kick in. I clench my stomach and release the toxins. Purging all the incorrect answers,sexual sin, lust or desire.Being talked over,ignored,Purging exhaustionand need for sleep. Purging the Truththe dishonestyand arms raised expecting to be struck.Purging the uglythe unwantedthe unlovable within mePurging whatevercaused themto leave. Purging the questions andthe spirit to fight back for myselfthat has done me no good thus farPurging the very essence of my identitytherefore purging the shame. I am now empty.“Good job,” I whisper to myself, “that was a close one.  

i cannot tell you to fix yourself or to stop whatever kind of self-destruction you’re doing, that would make me a hypocrite and if i can’t practice what i preach then that’s just not fair, but please don’t push yourself too far.  if you’re getting really light headed from malnutrition, at least eat a couple of snacks, something that can sustain you.  it’s not fair to let your body completely break down just in order to fit what you feel is the beauty standard, and i wish the pressure to lose weight was never reinstated in people, it fuckimg sucks.  im saying this because somebody dm’d me and told me to delete this account because it “glorifies mental illness and eating disorders” and it absolutely does not.  i do not try to make eating disorders seem cute or whatever the fuck, they’re painful, physically and mentally.  sometimes i can’t move because my stomach hurts so much from binging or from laxatives or from gastritis because i have been so destructive to my body, nothing about that is pretty.  i’d say that 80% of people with accounts like mine have them because it’s a release that they can’t have irl, it’s hard to talk about eating disorders with people who don’t understand, and on this website we can all understand each other.  but i understand that some things i post can be triggering and if you see something of mine that makes your eating disorder worse, please block me, i wont be offended.  i love all of you and hope that you’re able to be healthy and happy.  i know you can do it.

I totally understand why you feel this way anon, and I appreciate that it can seem as though there is a focus on anorexia amongst the eating disorder recovery community, which is not an accurate representation since in reality anorexia is actually the least common diagnosis. Although I do not know for sure, I have a feeling that this may be due to the stigma that sadly still exists about eating disorders, and in particular the misconceptions held about bulimia, OSFED and BED which may cause sufferers to feel reluctant about sharing their diagnosis, in contrast to anorexia sufferers for whom their diagnosis remains glorified both amongst general society and amongst the eating disorder community to a certain degree. Of course, this is absolutely not a situation I agree with, as all eating disorder diagnoses are equally as serious as each other, and all eating disorder sufferers - regardless of their specific diagnosis - deserves to recover, and it can be really beneficial to find other people in a similar situation with whom you relate when you are going through the recovery process. That said, I now for certain that there are people who are recovering from bulimia who run recovery blogs - and there are also people who are not specific about their diagnosis, thus “eating disorder recovery” could apply to any one of the four diagnoses - and I would encourage anyone who is recovering from bulimia to like or reblog this post, if you feel comfortable doing so, in order to highlight yourselves to anon, so that they might not feel so alone in their experiences of recovery. Also, have you tried searching the #actuallybulimia tags, anon? When they first came into usage, the #actually tags were created as a safe space for eating disorder sufferers to share posts about their illness without having to deal with the pro ana content which had flooded both the recovery and eating disorder related tags - although admittedly, toxic pro ana posts seem to have found their way into the #actually tags too, so they might not be ideal. Please know, however, that despite how it may be presented on tumblr, you are absolutely not alone in recovering from bulimia, and it is yet another harmful effect of the misconceptions that exist about eating disorders that has contributed to you feeling this way. Sending you all the very best with your continued recovery xx

You deserve to eat. Nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. (Please do not delete caption) 

Really enjoying the book I’m reading at the moment. I finally feel like I can trust my body again (though it’s slow progress). 
It’s quite lame though that when you google intuitive eating for ed recovery, there’s a lot of negative opinions. A meal plan should be followed first etc etc. Whilst I get that eating “normal” meals is important, particularly for anorexia recovery, since I’m suffering mainly from bulimia, I’ve tried to do a meal plan…. And it just makes me worse! I’ve felt restricted to sticking to it and so guilty when I’ve eaten something extra. Because I know I really shouldn’t, I’ve forced myself to eat all of the meals, despite sometimes not even being that hungry. But because I know I can’t just choose when I want to eat, I’ve always ate the food whilst it’s there. 
I’m also well aware of how to eat healthy and all that jazz. But it’s being able to trust myself to tell me when I’m hungry and full, rather than relying on a plan to tell me. And being able to actually have unhealthy food sometimes! Tbh because I know I can have unhealthy stuff, I haven’t really craved it…but before, even when following a plan since I didn’t have the freedom to choose what I wanted when I wanted, I would still binge. 
My next step now is know how to cope with boredom at work. I didn’t realise it before but that’s when I get emotional hunger. I don’t get it at home cos I sew and read all evening, but at work I can’t do that! I’m hoping when it gets busier over the next few months, that’ll help. It also doesn’t help cos my boss brings in cake and stuff every day! It’s literally right near me. I know it’s nice to enjoy cake every now and again, but then I’m finding I’m too full to have a proper dinner late on! 

YA KNOW WHAT? SELF HATE JUST ISN’T WORKING FOR ME ANYMORE SO WE’RE GONNA TRY SELF ACCEPTANCE INSTEAD. AND IT STARTS NOW 

having second thoughts and wishing for a deadly bmi 

After a HUGE junk-food-binge-eating/purging bender, I’m finally getting back on track. 
Unfortunately for me, my scale is done for so I can’t tell how much I fucked up just yet 
😓😓😓 

beyond grateful for over 700 days in recovery, next month will be TWO years since the day i chose to finally try and get better. it’s been extremely tough to do this, essentially, entirely on my own. i’ve had to give up a lot in the past two years to get to where i am and while it has been extremely isolating at some times, i have found the greatest hope and happiness in the people who have stayed and those i have gotten to know since i’ve been in recovery. i never thought 2.5 years ago when i was hours away from going into residential, when i refused treatment because i didn’t want to get better, when i was curled up trying to ease the physical ache of my eating disorder, when i would take the food from the secret stash i had hidden in my room and binge in isolation, when i would hide my bulimia from everyone i knew, that i would be living a live FREE from everything i thought would be my downfall. it did not come without tears and exhaustive hard work, but i am extremely thankful for the fight that led me to recovery and the 700 days since then. the 700 days also includes the last time i self-injured which had been a struggle and burden since i was 12 years old and something i never thought i would really be able to live without. it’s crazy what can change in a day.  


                — 
                Elizabeth Appell (my therapist reminded me of this today after I worked through a lot of grieving and I’m understanding just how important it is to blossom). 


QUESTION, are night sweats a thing during recovery? I’ve been getting them so bad since I started treatment but I don’t know if it’s to do with ed stuff or if i should be looking into other things? 

Growing up I was always told to hide the things that make me different.  It was never acceptable to show any form of negative emotion, or to speak about the things that were bothering me. Mental illness was always a taboo subject and never accepted. It wasn’t until recently that I learned that this was incredibly unhealthy, and that I shouldn’t be afraid to speak about my recover process. 

While those around you may seem happy and healthy, you would be surprised at how many people are suffering in silence.

It is estimated that 450 million people in the world currently are suffering from at least one psychiatric disorder. This includes your neighbors, family members, friends, teachers, and anyone else that you may meet.  It doesn’t matter where you come from, your gender, your sexuality, your race, etcetera, mental illness doesn’t discriminate. It has the ability to impact anyone, and it isn’t fair for those who are struggling to do it alone. Whether you prefer to talk with someone you trust or a professional,I highly suggest that you reach out. Mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of and don’t let someone who is ignorant or doesn’t understand convince you otherwise. Speak up about mental health and do not hide who you are.  

Your life was not better when you were sick.Your life was not better when you counted the calories in your head of everything you ate, an endless nightmare of numbers for your malnourished brain. Your life was not better when you crawled back to the gym for your second or third workout of the day. Your life was not better when you referred to your safe foods as “skinny people food,” when you turned down the ice cream trip with your best friends, when you failed your exams because you couldn’t pay attention in lecture because you were starving. Your life was not better when a flight of stairs felt like an endless mountain, or when you measured your coffee creamer with a teaspoon. Your life was not better when you spent everyday shaking and cold, your body unable to keep itself warm no matter how many layers of sweaters you put on. I know. Recovery is hell. It feels like an endless nightmare of battles that you are fighting all alone and most days you wish you were sick so you wouldn’t have to think about fighting anymore. I know you are exhausted. I know you think your life was better when you didn’t have to deal with all of this. But it’s not true, it was not better. That’s your eating disorder talking, not you.Your voice is the sound of laughing with children, the sound of you nailing a really important interview, the sound of you admiring your significant other, of arranging a coffee and pastries date with your best friend. Your voice is the one of your soul, your beautiful and treasured soul that only wants what is best for you. Your eating disorder, on the other hand, is the voice of death. And it’s lying to you. 

Recovery…what a wild ride! It is impossible to gage how your experience throughout this journey will go and what it will look like. That is why I think that we all need to be compassionate with our fellow recovery warriors. Some people will reach a strong and solid state of remission with no restriction in sight and feel totally secure in themselves. Others will get their intake up but still struggle with fear foods and ED thoughts during times of stress. Some will focus on the mental more than the physical and some will go full out restoring their weight while ignoring the cognitive issues. ED’s exist on a spectrum and everyone will have a different level of challenges to address. Lets try to be respectful of that and lift each other up as a community. We are all fighting the same deadly mental illness. 

TWi honestly didn’t think i’d make it to 16 years old, hell i didnt even think i’d make it to my gcse exams but here i am!! i’ve done 5 of my exams so far and i feel ok! Mentally i feel like i’m slipping - exams are keeping me occupied for now but i don’t see it lasting long. i’m trying to enjoy the moment and think of the future but anorexia is so webbed into my mind that i dont even feel like myself anymore, i can’t remember the food i enjoy because i’ve been denied it for so long - when i think about what i eat it’s like re-reading the same books over and over again; i know every word, every detail and i can’t change that, something new is something scary and something that will of course inevitably make me fattoday i tried to test myself, i had a normal sized lunch and then desert and i’ve also had some birthday cake! it doesnt feel like a step towards a recovery mindset because i’ve been terrified of this day for weeks and i’ve still counted every calorie. i’m just not in the right mindset - i dont want to change, i feel comforted and in control with knowing what i’m putting in my body. to me it doesnt even really feel like a problem because its so engraved into me! sure i think about pizza but it’s like common sense to me that i cant have it; there’s no debating or wishing i could have it because it just seems practical not to.i don’t know what will happen next for me, finish my gcse’s and then what? i know i’ll likely get hospitaised sooner or later but i just dont care enough about myself to fight anymore - the old me has gone and anorexia has finally taken over.

                It’s only when I feel like I’m dying that I actually start living            


Does anybody else get confused between feelings of hunger and feelings of nausea? Like I honestly can’t distinguish between the two sometimes. 

Destroy the idea that women who get eating disorders are ditzy and self-absorbed  

Every Time I think about relapse I have to stop, pause and think about the outcome of doing that…
All the tears that will be shed 
Shouts and screams at mealtimes 
The days I will lose and opportunities missed 
Friends that will be tired of waiting 
Education that will be missed out on
Holidays and family occasions that have to be cancelled because of me 
So then I think again and realise do I want to go through all of this and more just to lose weight and listen to the bully in my head.
The answer to that everytime will be no and I will get up in the morning and show this bitch of an ED everything I’m made of 💪🏻 



Ed:
                                                you probably shouldn't eat dinner, it's going to make you fat!                    

Me:
                                                Why would you say that?? I need to eat so I can live.                    

Ed:
                                                shut up! You know nothing. I'm the only one here for you, I was the only one there for you when you had no one else. Who do you actually have?                    

Me:
                                                I have ME. I have ME and I will always be enough! I don't need you anymore!                    



so, i changed my url. i do not want to be my eating disorder, and I refuse to let myself be reduced to it. my recovery, my awareness work, my desires to help others - they are part of who I am. But that’s the thing: they are part of me, but not all of me. Who I am, is wild. And I am determined to embrace it.so if you need me, you can find me at embracingwild :-) 

also why do people bitch about people in the recovery tag posting pictures of breakfast and puppies and stuff, like eating disorders are gritty and horrific and there is nothing cutesy about them. But some days eating breakfast is a challenge and if I beat that with a pretty bowl of oatmeal I’m going to bloody well post a picture of it and then reblog puppies for the entire day - stop adding more hate to this disorder!!! 

Just a little project I’m working on. 

Michelle PahlYou got up this morning, stretched and staggered into the kitchen. Depending on your preference, you waited impatiently for coffee or tea, and then set about completing your morning routine. Maybe you’re a breakfast eater. Maybe not. You showered, got dressed and got ready to face the day, either at work or at home, again depending on where you are in your life. Lunch time rolled around and you were hungry, so you grabbed some food. An all-in-one meal from a fast food restaurant, or maybe you made yourself a sandwich. You were hungry a little later so you had some chips and a soda. You were going to make something for dinner, but friends called, so you headed out to the pub for some appetizers and dinner, maybe a beer or two. Once back at home, you did a few chores, watched some TV, grabbed another snack and once you were tired, you headed off to bed. As you were brushing your teeth, you realized you didn’t get in any exercise, but figured you’d get to it tomorrow, no big deal. You didn’t count calories. You didn’t give much thought to what you ate. You didn’t beat yourself up and call yourself foul names because you didn’t exercise. It never once occurred to you to throw up your dinner. You lived your day complete with food and friends because that’s how you do life. It’s what would be considered “normal.”I haven’t had a day like that since I was 11 years old and since I’m 46 now, that’s a long time to go without touching normal.I’ve met people over the course of my life that, once they learn I have an eating disorder, are eager to share the story of their own forays down that dark path. They talk about how they “used to be bulimic” because one summer at camp a group of them all decided to throw up their dinner every day, but then once they got home, they were cured. The talk about how they “used to be anorexic” because once, for a month, they ate only fruit and lost 15 pounds, but then they stopped and were cured. The anecdotes go on and on.It seems that some people, except those afflicted, want to lay claim to an eating disorder. Implicit in their stories is the question why; why can’t I stop if they did? Believe me, if I could have stopped, I would have. If I could’ve changed my thought patterns so that every moment wasn’t an exercise in self-hatred, I would have. Those conversations enrage me. Trying on some bad eating behaviors for a period and then abandoning them is not the same as having an eating disorder.When I broke up with my first love, I rebounded into alcohol and reckless behavior. A lot of alcohol. However, after a couple of months of getting drunk every weekend, of living with the hangovers and the empty wallet and the spotty memory, I’d had enough. I stopped. Drinking with reckless enthusiasm for a couple of months is not the same as being an alcoholic. It meant that I acted badly for a couple of months and then straightened up. I have yet to “straighten up” from my eating disorder. But my point is this: a few months of aberrant eating does not mean you have an eating disorder. For that, count yourself lucky.I am currently five months “sober.” That means, for the last five months, I’ve eaten relatively normally; three meals and a couple of snacks every day, no excessive exercising, no vomiting. This is the longest I have been abstinent of eating disorder behavior (excluding the three months I spent at a rehab, and even there I restricted somewhat) since I was 19.An eating disorder is not a game. An eating disorder is hell. It has the highest mortality rate of any mental illness. It’s starving yourself until you can’t sleep, until you can’t think, until you can’t do anything but think about the next allotment of food. It’s driving around in your car from fast-food restaurant to fast-food restaurant, spending $20 at a time, shoving the food down your throat so fast it has no taste and then vomiting until the blood vessels in your eyes burst. It’s lying to everyone about your eating patterns and weight loss and weight gain. It’s learning to shop at a variety of different food stores so no one is aware of how much you’re buying. It’s lying to cashiers about this or that upcoming party so they don’t question the cakes and ice cream. It’s exercising for four hours straight and still hating yourself for the flesh on your bones. It’s thousands and thousands of dollars spent on food you throw up, exercise equipment you abuse and products to hide the evidence – air fresheners, breath mints and garbage bags for when you have to throw up in your room. It’s eating for an hour and throwing up for an hour, over and over for days on end until you pass out. It’s vomiting until there’s blood coming up from your lacerated esophagus and seeping from the infected sores on your hands. It’s shoplifting laxatives, water pills and mouthwash so that no one knows how much of them you use. It’s ulcers in your stomach, a devastated bone density and teeth rotting and falling out. It’s the knowledge you’re killing yourself and being desperate to stop, but continuing the behavior anyway. It’s starving yourself for a month and then binging for three days straight, vomiting until you pass out. It’s suicidal thoughts and attempts. It’s feeling like you can’t live in the hell your life has become.What isn’t it? It isn’t a transitory thing you try on. It isn’t a crash diet. It’s not the same as that time you had the stomach flu for a whole weekend. It’s doctors who don’t understand you, nurses who deride you, emergency room personnel who judge you and ambulance drivers who think you’re wasting their time. It’s a family you are devastating and friends who beg you to get help because everyone is watching you kill yourself slowly. It’s wanting help, but to accept it would mean you’d get “fat,” and to you, that would make you just as much a failure as you already are.It’s hell.But I’m five months free of my behavior. The other side, all the underlying crap that drives the behavior, that’s harder. I struggle to believe I have value if I’m not skeletal. I struggle to believe people actually care about me; that they will like me even if I’m not perfect. I struggle with my voice, the one thing I want to learn to share. I want to be authentic; I want to say “to hell with you” to the people out there that judge, and criticize and detract. I want to grow a thick skin. I want to be able to say I love myself, I’m happy with myself and I’m an OK person — and believe it.But for now, for today, I will take the five months and consider myself blessed. 

Reminder: Everything will be okay in the end. Now go rest, tomorrow is a brand new day.  

This conversation made me tear up so much. I always felt that my eating disorder resulted in me neglecting my little brother, and I’ve lived with the guilt of that for years. Guys–your families still love you. They’ll always love you, even when they’re irrationally furious with you. And it does get better.

Tomorrow I will eat breakfast and I won’t freak out and it will all be just fine. 

wtfi’m back to find out i have over 300 followers ??? wtf ??? how ???i’m so incredibly greatful. i know i haven’t been active so i just wanted to update y’all that i’m finally starting to recover. i’ll try to keep posting some more positive stuff but i may try to stay away from blogs like these since they can be triggering. stay safe, i love all 300+ of u 💕💕💕

More like skip dinner, wake up at 3am freezing cold, even though you’re wearing three extra layers and your skin is covered in a thin layer of hair; you can’t remember when your hands were last warm.
Skip dinner because no matter how long you stared at the child size portion of food in front of you, and no matter how much your mum begged you to “at least try”, you couldn’t bring yourself to pick up the fork
Skip dinner and still hate yourself as you step on the scale and off the scale and on the scale and off, staring at the number that’s never going to be low enough, wishing for the day it reads nothing.
Skip dinner and wake up in a coffin and your brother wonders if it even contains a body at all.
Skip dinner and throw away your whole entire life because anorexia fucking kills people it’s not diet cokes and thigh gaps it’s a disease. 

And what people really need to be aware of! 
If one person starts to relapse and displays that on their blog, it seems like it is extremely easy for others to fall into the same trap, almost like it’s infectious. You won’t always notice it, but seeing other people in the recovery community struggling when you are trying to fight might affect you a lot worse than you realise. You say it doesn’t trigger you, but an eating disorder is a competitive illness and more often than not it’s your subconsciousness that takes control and without even realising, you’ve started displaying symptoms again/your symptoms have gotten worse/ you’ve developed new symptoms. 
I am not blaming anyone who is honest about their struggles on their blog in any way. I just want the readers to be aware of this and be able to intervene in their behaviours BEFORE it turns into a relapse. 
This is a real problem and a serious downside to this site, though it also has many great sides such as loads of supportive people that send cute messages and it can be therapeutic for people to write about their life and struggles. Just be aware of the danger it contains. 
Don’t let other bloggers “infect” you. You are your own warrior and responsible for your own recovery. Don’t let other bloggers’ struggles affect your progress. Just because someone else is struggling doesn’t mean that you have to too. Your recovery is your responsibility. 

-My sweet therapist who is 100% done with my shit 

That time I almost accidentally ran over my therapist I was biking home from work and I stopped short at a redlight and nearly ran over my ex-therapist. She was on the phone and glared at me. Then I saw the look of recognition on her face and she kept walking and kept her head turned away from me completely while she waited at the corner. She always gave me such weird bad vibes and I literally felt so gross afrer that near run in 😡 she’s one of those people who makes my stomach turn. Idk what it is about her that I find so unsettling. I always felt like she was kinda stone cold. K always gave me such a positive and warm vibe and always seemed like such actually cared about what happened to me. On the other hand, J always made me feel like the whole thing was just one big business transaction. Idk. Just so glad I never have to see her again.  

YO THANKS FOR 300 FOLLOWERSthat’s lovely, but god, please seek help!!! you deserve to thrive ❤(anons always open) 

i wonder at what weight ppl are gna stop telling me i look skinny “but still healthy”how low would i have to get for ppl to worry instead of make positive comments about my health??i was at a healthy weight before. now i’m significantly underweight. stop telling me i “look good” or “look better” and implying that my healthy body was one that needed improvement in the first place. it’s comments like that that make recovery so ridiculously hard  

 

Eating Disorder Confession #3I became vegetarian just so I could limit more of what I eat and means people won’t ask questions when I don’t eat certain things 

PLEASE REMEMBERto eat small portions at a time, because if you eat more than what your stomach can take, you’ll feel sick!!! (yes talking from experience, yes i just ate too much and now everything hurts)small portions, but loads of them! it takes time for your stomach to expand, be patient <3take care of your body!!! you deserve to eat, you deserve to thrive!

If any of my witchy followers could send a weight loss spell my direction that would be great please and thanks  

 

me: today i’m gonna eat healthily. i’ll try not to binge. my ed, later the same day: 

I’ve recently reconnected with a boy I was friends with a few years ago. When I first met him, we were both struggling with eating disorders, and we helped each other through a lot. But I moved schools, and we lost touch. Then a few weeks ago, I started going rollerskating with some of my friends, and he was there.And he’s recovered, and I’m so fucking happy for him. He told me about when he went to the hospital, and how his girlfriend helped him so much. And it was so nice to see him so happy and full of energy and confidence. But he’s also put on a lot of weight. He’s pretty chubby now, and he’s happier like this, but honestly, all I could think about was how it all went to waste and how much better he looked before, and I’m disgusted with myself.

I wish I had a friend who understood what it was like growing up with an eating disorder and how it’s still affecting me to this day. I’m struggling so much with my body image rn and I could just use someone to lean on who won’t judge me for the thoughts I keep having. (Recovery talk only, I’m not interested in glorifying illness).  

why do i think restricting my eating will solve all my problems? 

me: wow i’m doing so great with not purgingmy eating disorder: ha ha hame: what???my eating disorder: you’ve been walking 8+ miles a day, swimming and doing yoga and burning all the calories you’re taking in anyway and calling it healthyme: wow fucking rudeme: *does another workout routine* 

my relationship with my eating disorder is like… all of those posts that tell you every bad thing that could happen such as tearing your esophagus (more than once) or throwing up blood, scarring your fingers, messing up your teeth, hurting your jaw, being hospitalized, etc & I always think “well that will never happen to me” every single time but then it does and I’m constantly surprised but also thoroughly over all of it at this point. right now I just want painkillers and a hug. 

When you want to lose weight but know you can’t… 

I have some wonderful people in my life. When I think about it, I am so lucky. Recovery has to be something that starts in an entirely self-motivated way, but having support from people you love is so beneficial to the process. I think the most fucked up aspect of an eating disorder is the way it destroys your ability to see yourself as deserving. I think about the first time the decision to attempt to recover felt like something I truly wanted for myself in the moment… I was in high school. At the time this wasn’t something I realized, but I felt like I had no one. In retrospect, I was so sick that I couldn’t see how anyone could possibly care about me.My self-awareness has changed. This is growing. Still, it is so hard to feel like I deserve any of the time, support, or love my friends have to offer. It is so much easier to push people away, and if we’re into personifying mental illness, then that is fundamentally what my eating disorder wants. While I think that I have moved beyond my teenage desire to poetically waste away or whatever romanticized bullshit I clung to back then, part of me is still sick. And that is so difficult to admit because another fucked up part of having an eating disorder is the displacement that comes from being open about recovery. I often feel that I don’t have the language to communicate how much I’m struggling on a daily basis. Even when I’m able to eat three meals and not purge, I’m struggling. Etc, etc. Maybe this comes from a place of fear, but I also frequently feel like my friends are only interested in the healing version of me and I do not have room to make mistakes or ask for help or be anything other than strong. Still, I think one of the biggest steps I’ve taken in recovery is the realization that there are people who care about me, and don’t want to see me in this miserable, self-loathing place forever. Even if I’m not there for myself yet, and even if I can’t fully believe I have a right to be happy, healthy, and whole… there are people who believe that for me. Which is beautiful and stressful at the same time. It’s terrifying, but it is also progress. You know? 

I post a lot of happy moments on here, major accomplishments i’ve had, friends i’ve made, the beautiful experiences that only happen when you are coming back to life after an eating disorder.But I am not perfect. I do not say this to be humble, I say this as a fact. I am interwoven with flaws, I am not some emotionless recovery warrior who has it all figured out. and right now, I am struggling.No, I am not relapsing. Yes, my weight is stable. No, I am not overexercising or counting calories. But I am down. I am sad about my body, about eating, looking in mirrors, about myself. It is not a hospitalization-inducing crisis, but it is darkness. Every day, draining and unrelenting. And so I must take steps to eat more, even though everything is medically okay and I’m eating “enough”. And I may ask for help when I need it, as much as it pains me to do so. But I am not posting this with the intention of disappointing you all. I am posting this because I want to be more open. I want to find the bravery in being vulnerable. I do not ever want my blog to be an inaccurate representation of me. I want people to continue to ask me for help because that’s what helps me. And I want people to know that they are not alone in being imperfect. Your recovery is not supposed to be flawless. Progress is all over the place, not in a straight line. So please do not EVER think that you are not “good enough” at recovery because you are struggling. You are good enough. Nothing could ever take that away from you.

                one year into recovery            


I kinda lost control and binged after being binge and purge free for 9 days, but the thing is I didn’t purge. Even though I’m feeling disgusted and bloated right now, I convinced myself that purging would only make things worse and that I already made a promise to myself that I will stop bulimia for good. And because of that commitment, I didn’t purge even though there was a strong urge to do it for about 30 minutes and I cried while fighting the urge to do so.
Today was definitely not a setback, it just happened to test how strong I was at facing difficult situations, and I’m proud to say that instead of choosing to hurt myself, I chose to move on and most importantly, forgive myself. 

You know what really really irritates me??? The people who say they are recovered but are actually still very poorly. 
I was thinking about it earlier whilst sending a message to one of the most inspiring and determined people I know and in my opinion (because this is my opinion and nothing else) those out there who claim to be recovered from eating disorders on social media are probably the most damaging and stigma imposing (I don’t know the correct way to say they back up the views of ignorant people, of those who also suffer and strengthen stigma) people with in online communities.
At the moment I see a lot of ‘this community has become toxic’ in various social media sites. Part of this is due to people who are pro Illness saying damaging things which back up a persons beliefs, but I personally think the problem lies more in those who claim to be recovered, but are 1) still under weight 2) still using behaviours or avoiding food 3) switching between illness (towards orthorexia commonly).
You see those who are pro Illness are niiave and ignorant and often ill them selves. They are people strongly influenced by the society we live in and have many insecurities because of that. Those who are pro illness have not been subject to the harsh reality that maybe it distracts from in problem, but an illness in its self is a whole lot worse. 
But those people who are spreading the message that they are recovered with out restoring to a healthy weight, with out been able to eat out still or the same meal as their families, those who eat, but still in a restrictive way- they are aware of the pain cause by developing a mental illness (specifically an eating disorder) they are aware of the emotional and physical pain. They have felt the torment first hand. They know the physical consequences are very real and the impact it has upon the whole of their lives. Yet by claiming to be well when they aren’t, they are allowing people to look up to them, in a way which could be very harmful. 
How many times do you see someone who is 'recovered’ eating a salad when your meal plan says x and then question why should you be eating x? It makes you feel additional doubt and guilt. 
How often do you see those who are 'recovered’ going to the gym everyday or becoming obsessed with certain food groups (protein) and then question why you can’t go to the gym everyday or feel pressured to add extra of one food group and less of another? 
How often do you look at you weight restoring or restored body and compare yourself to the 'recovered 'person and feel your body image worsening and yourself asking why they were allowed to remain one size when you are told you keep in gaining? 
You see the general public know very little about Illness. Those who are pro Illness have a distorted view of what it’s like built on ignorance. But those who were ill and have now 'recovered’, well they have been there and as an individual suffering we look at them with hope. Hope of recovery yes, but also disordered hopes. Hope that we will only ever have to eat clean food, that we can keep avoiding food groups or exercise everyday. We look at the small size and believe we can stop there to or we can keep set meal times….
But the truth is, we can not recover by doing things half heartedly. In recovery we can’t compromise or meet in the middle with the Illness. In recovery we have to give up every rule and every behaviour. And unless we do that, we can never trust live. If we hang on to parts of an illness, in a way we can disguise, we are just as poorly as someone in the deaths of a disorder. We still are consumed by thoughts and limited by our fears. 
Recovery is something which we have to choose say in and day out-even on the days we don’t want it. Recovery is challenging everything you thought you knew and learning what really is true. Recovery is crying for hours and planning a relapse, but still avoiding the gym or the bathroom and instead eating something extra.  Recovery isn’t easy and any change towards recovery is extremely positive. However for those contemplating recover or struggling in recovery, those who claim the be recovered whilst living a disordered life (and most likely being in denial of those fact) can be very damaging both emotional and physical to others. 

Guys! Today I’ve been purge-free for a year!!! 

some days I don’t even think about my eating disorder anymore and some days I do. at times my head is so caught in the moment I’m overcome with joy, but at other times it’s so caught in the past I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to dig myself out. I go for weeks without weighing myself, not caring about having fried food twice in a day and shaking off  body negative comments; then, at the strangest moments life comes crashing down and I’m paralyzed with numbers and behaviors in one big crashing wave. and that’s recovery for you. 
each interruption, each meltdown will eventually grow farther and farther apart ‘til it becomes something you deal with once a month, once a year, once a decade. 
recovery is slow, tedious and boring but it is worth it, it just takes time. 

Beyoncé doesn’t have a thigh gap so why should I have one? 

I wanted to eat. Okay, I know what snacking turns into; I wanted to binge. I didn’t. Slow progress is still progress because bunging turns to purging & I didn’t do either. 

To everyone of my amazing followers 😘

I know that my bulimia will never fully go away and even though I’m “recovered” I’ll always be dealing with it and battling it, probably for the rest of my life. Some days are worse than others.. and today it’s harder to deal with the urges. I’ve been doing pretty well so far, I just feel disappointed that I’m struggling again. 

Today I have eaten:
2 bowls of porridge
A slice of cake
A sandwich, salad and a scone with jam and butter (not any of the flora rubbish, actual butter)
A slice of cheesecake
A bowl of porridge and an ubley yogurt
A massive piece of battered fish and chips from the local chippy.
This is the closest to recovered I have ever been.
P.s. i havent b/p for a month now.
It’s possible guys. Trust me. 

I just ate and I want more food. I’m not hungry and I know this craving is due to anxiety. It’s frustrating wanting to go to food but not being able to. I need to find ways to deal with my anxiety better. That’s the biggest thing I’m dealing with. I’ll talk with my psychiatrist the next time I’m see him because my anxiety is getting stronger and stronger. 
It sucks and I want to use eating disorder behaviors and even though I want to, I know I can’t because it’ll only get rid of the anxiety for the short term. 
I have this emptiness in my stomach that I want to fill but I’ll end up overeating. 
I’m having a rough time 

Cook the oats with water the night before. Leave it to soak overnight. Heat it up.seriously fluffy oatmeal  

I took a hip hop burlesque dance fitness class today and it was pretty cool! Of course my ED is like “hey look at the moves your doing, it would look better if you were thinner” but I was just trying to keep in tracking. It was fun. 
My mom mentioned something that insurance can cover a personal trainer but that’s not fun at all. Like the focus is all on changing your body basically, at least it would be for me. Like I know there’s parts of you to see increase of strength and all that but for me it’ll just be on changes in my body which is not good. So I told her it’s not fun and I’d rather do fun stuff. 
I’m getting to do more movement and not avoiding it and that’s great! I would’ve walked to work today if it wasn’t so cold but I’m not bummed about that, like I was tired and it was freezing why torture myself lol. 
It’s been good. 

You do not need permission to nourish your body
You do not need permission to enjoy food you like
You do not need permission to eat junk food sometimes 
You do not need permission to love yourself 
You do not need permission to live a happy, healthy, and fulfilling life. 

Dear Anybody in Recovery from an Eating Disorder,I don’t know much about much, but I do know that eating a white bread roll with your dinner, or a plate of non-wholegrain pasta, or a massive stack of non-vegan, non-protein powder added pancakes will not kill you. In fact, you’ll be provided with the energy, and yes, the nutrients that you need to restore the health of your body.You didn’t restore your weight purely by lifting weights and visiting the gym daily? You ain’t shredded as fuck, bruh? There’s no hint of a six-pack on your adorable stomach? That’s perfectly okay. You’re allowing yourself to develop a healthy attitude with exercise before and IF you decide you want to add some extra muscle and tone. You’re STILL beautiful. You’re beautiful because of your courage. You’re beautiful because of your spirit. You’re beautiful because of your unique character. You’re beautiful because you’re trying to pull yourself out of the hole of hellishness you found yourself in. Give yourselves a break. Nobody’s recovery is ‘perfect’. What matters is that you’re honest to yourself and that you remain committed to changing your life for the better.<3 

people always seem surprised when they realize how much I work out/how muscular I am/how I still dislike most sports because well yeah, I’m the girl who forged a doctor’s acquittal just to get out of pe lessons and still has occasional nightmares about the humiliation and pain of waterpolo trainings. well, for me working out (and I mean hiit, kickboxing and strength training 5 times a week each time 30 to 90 minutes) is a crucial mindfulness practice and a way of keeping mental clarity. also, as an in-recovery bulimic, a way to admire my 173 centimeters and 72 kilograms of bones and muscle, strength and endurance. 

Eating more calories is NOT unhealthy when your body needs them!! 

I’m not fat I’m not fat I’m not fat. 

Keep reading 

Shout out to all those who are currently relapsing and still have a ‘healthy’ body weight. Having everyone assume you are fine because your body looks that way is so frustrating and it can make that voice in the back of your head so much louder, but you’re not alone in this. Stick at it lovelies. 

I’m starting to think this disorder will never leave me 

I have to avoid enough diet/weightloss thoughts coming from my own mind, being surrounded by “dieting, lose ten pounds this week!, eat less, lose weight” from media, friends, family etc. is too much.  

I’ve been recovering for roughly a month and only purged for like 7 of the days!!! I’m so fucking proud of myself! 

Well, I’m going to try my best to be happy about this.I am officially twenty pounds above my lowest weight. It’s a healthy weight for my age and height. It is healthy. Healthy does not mean bad. Healthy is good. Missing my unhealthy looking body isn’t horrible, but it isn’t to be dwelled on. I need to accept myself, be happy, and keep moving forward no matter how scared and unsure I am. One day I will see my beauty. One day. 

So I ate a whole block of chocolate without thinking last night and that was the hardest fucking night for a long time. No purging allowed, even when you binge. fuuuuuuck.
Anyway I am really proud of myself for keeping that shit down. I even ate breakfast this morning when I was hungry!
This post is a bit boastful but it’s my blog so if there’s any place to do it it’s here lol.
6 months of recovery and attempting to love my body, yo! 

I have recently sunk back to ed behaviour of regular binging and bulimia. I have regained almost all of my recent weight loss. I have been depressed and angry and self destructive. I binge and then i regret it and hate myself so I throw it all bk up and then I feel crap from throwing up so I just binge again. 
But today recovery starts again. I’m stronger than this, I’m better than this and I deserve to live a happy functional life. Since I relapsed my life us becoming less and less functional but I can overcome this. Recovery day one is today and u will fight off this darkness I won’t let my daemons win 

I’m trying to implement the principles of brain over binge today and it is soo hard. I’ve eaten breakfast, snack, lunch and snack. Dinner shouldn’t be for another couple of hours yet my head is screaming FOOD FOOD FOOD. I don’t need it, I know I don’t. This habit will never go unless I challenge it, so I have no choice but to stay strong. FFS. 

Today wasn’t the greatest.  I walked through the food store with my mother reading different labels calories and sugar amounts, I sat in church alone, at the 8:30 service think of the half of bagel that I had ate for breakfast. I thought of my calorie journal more than ten times.  Setting limits for the rest of the day thinking of what I should and shouldn’t eat.  I thought for a while that it might be good to slip back into my old ways, give up on recovery, just lose a little bit of weight. Reflecting on today I actually see how far I have come. Recovery might not be easy, you’ll have set backs, but in the end it will be worth it. 

yesterday was good 

wow i love when i get so insecure that i hyperventilate walking past people in the halls
i love apologizing for my body mentally every five minutes
super love it 

after today I am never going to binge and purge again and I’m finally going to recover from this hell. if I ever binge and purge again please murder me, thank 

I did it. I ate pasta today. Pasta is my number 1 fear food and I did it. I ate it. I’m so happy. I ate it and was able to control the thoughts. I wish everyday of recovery felt this good. 

Woke up early to go for a run before school but my body was still tired and I didn’t want to go so I didn’t force myself :) #progress 

So my mom bought my caramel almond- almond butter and it’s magical. 

I don’t know what’s worse:the fact that I did that just nowthe fact that it’s been at least a year since the last timeor the fact that I lived 6 years of my life that way 

Okay, so I would definitely recommend you check out real-talk-recovery - whilst this is a recovery blog focused on recovery from eating disorders generally, it is full of advice and information and just a really thorough recovery-orientated resource. In terms of recovery blogs specific to bulimia and/or OSFED, I’m sure there are some, but all that is coming to mind are blogs run by individuals who are suffering from either bulimia or OSFED, rather than blogs focused on recovery from the illnesses. Hopefully some of my followers will be able to help out with recommendations tho. x 

Okay so I ate a donut today and continued to eat normally. I also had a cookie later on and didn’t binge. For dinner I ate at my friend’s house and I had to have a whole big meal including meat and potatoes, with full fat sour cream. TOTAL FEAR FOODS. And later on at home I got hungry. I made brownies. And I had a small piece. And I didn’t binge. And I wanted a snack for Netflix so I had some popcorn. And even though I wanted to binge, I brushed my teeth instead. Now I’m in bed about to fall asleep. I DID IT. I had unhealthy food today. I didn’t binge. And I exercised the same as I usually would instead of becoming super discouraged after my unhealthy food. I had fear foods and didn’t binge. I BAKED and didn’t binge. This is all so out of my character. I’m progressing!!! 

Food should be scared of ME, ‘cause I’ll eat it. 🍪🍖🧀 

Sometimes I base my feelings of ‘being fat’ on how full my stomach feels to me and that’s just weird. The content of my stomach on any given moment does not define my body shape. 

Eating disorder realization:I saw my nutritionist today after 3 weeks of food, symptom and water logging. I knew things were not the greatest but, I thought I was doing okay. She reviewed my log and symptoms and then pushed her hair back with her glasses and looked at me. The realization came from these words:She asked in the sweetest most motherly words, “Kaitlyn, what do you think it will take for you to get better? Does any of this concern you?” I told her that I am doing well, I am accomplishing things, working, succeeding, I am high functioning. She said, “At what cost? At what cost are you high functioning? I see you sliding backwards with all your life loads, taking baby steps backwards. You are just making it and putting on an “everything is fine” face. At any time though, you could have renal problems, kidney issues, you could rupture your stomach or have a torn esophagus, and you could even develop type 1 diabetes because of your hypoglycaemia and family history. Through the tests I have run (GSR for digestion etc.) and blood tests, your body is not okay. It is not the matter of if something will happen but rather when it will. I am going to be honest with you, I admire you. I admire that you can hide your illness and still do all you do. But, at what cost?”I have always thought of myself as high-functioning. I have even been told by the few friends who know what I am working on and even an old therapist, that I am high functioning and I must be A-okay. It’s not that bad because I am high-functioning. I am successful, I accomplish things, I work hard, I am a nationally ranked dancer and have several provincial championship titles under my belt. But, here’s the catch. You do not need to look sick or be non-functional when you are sick. It doesn’t matter what type of eating disorder you have. Eating disorders do not discriminate. They look different on every individual who has one. Not every person with an eating disorder looks sick or acts sick. They could be active-a dancer, a swimmer, runner, soccer player, anyone. They could be balancing work, activities, school, all in one and still look okay. So, eating disorders kill. And (close to) no one may know there is an issue. 

I’m not sure if you know this but asking someone in recovery their weight makes you an asshole.
Asking how many times someone pukes also kinda makes you an asshole.
And telling me to just stop eating instead?  Thank you ever so much for that. Ive got a whole lotta fuck you in return just as soon as I calm down. 
Satisfy your curiosity somewhere else where you wont trigger people. Try google. 

Chocolate covered raisins at work. It’s been a while since I had dessert because I’m always scared of bingeing but they were there and free and I wanted em and oh my GOD it’s true that when you go slow and savor every bite it’s a heavenly experience. I do not miss bingeing and I’m very grateful for recovery right now. 

I had another session with Robert my new therapist yesterday. He really is brilliant, he is helping me break down the ED like no one else has. Today I ate a sandwich for lunch and wasn’t triggered to b/p. :) I genuinely don’t even remember the last time I made myself a sandwich to eat, rather than b/p, I’m so pleased, super progress here! And it was delicious!  Cheese, salad and mustard.
I’ve been back at the gym, did a short treadmill run and some strength work. I’ve significantly lowered the weights now I’m pregnant, but it feels so good to be back there. I have identified a problem with my left glute while doing split squats, which also explains why I’m getting lower back pain on the left side while running. Going to try and stretch and massage it out. As I’m not running too much I don’t think it will cause any problems. 
Still haven’t got my letter through for my scan, I want it! Can’t wait to find out if we are having a boy or girl. 

Hey everyone! So instead going to the Eating Recovery Center of Denver, I WILL instead be going to Remuda Ranch at the Meadows women’s eating disorder residential treatment center located in Wickenburg, Arizona. I will be flying out either on Saturday or Sunday of this week, depending on air fare. While I’m there, I won’t be able to have my cell phone, but I’ll definitely be able to write and receive letters and mail! I don’t want the post the address until I’m actually there and know what unit I’m on, etc. but if you can send me a message with your address if you want to be pen pals please do!! 💜 I will be there for a few months, but I plan on being back to continue my music education degree at Texas State University in fall of 2016 and am determined to make permanent changes and kick the power out of this illness so I can live the life I was made to. Every donation you have sent in (equalling almost one thousand dollars in a little over a week!) is going to be making a big difference for me and being able to afford my care, even if $1k is only a dent in the expenses in the long run. So thank you SO MUCH and I’m going to be taking down the Go Fund Me soon, just know I am so so grateful for the support I’ve received even from strangers.
I love you so much and I will try to keep you updated! I’m amping up my tumblr queue so that when I’m admitted I don’t ~entirely~ fall off the face of the earth. 

You know that feeling when you look at yourself and you feel awful and disgusted? well it sucks 

Hey there!  I don’t think it sounds weird at all that being around food in general would be difficult for you right now.  I don’t think that not wanting to do this says anything negative about you.  There are so many ways to get out of the house and do community service that don’t involve food and may be more emotionally fulfilling for you because you could focus on the good work instead of the constant barrage of ED thoughts.  Have you thought about other options such as providing childcare at a domestic violence shelter, helping out at a retirement community, providing socialization and care to shelter pets, working on environmental remediation, etc?  There are many ways to send your compassion into the world.  I would try VolunteerMatch to see what options might be available around you.  You may find something that you are able to be really passionate about. The need for community service doesn’t end when the holiday season ends, so maybe you could even find something that you’d like to continue!As for talking to your mom, especially with such a new diagnosis, it might be difficult for her to understand why it would be better for you to provide service in an alternative way.  If you’re working with a treatment team or therapist, they might be able to help you sit down with your mom and explain things.  If you don’t want to do any of this, that’s fair too.  Whatever you need to do to get better.  Everyone’s parents are different– I think mine would have just accepted an alternate plan as long as I proposed one.  I think the bottom line sounds like you’re a person who wants to help but that this particular opportunity would distract from the good you would be doing.I hope this helps!  Community service can be a great way to help build a sense of self outside of one’s eating disorder and you have the right to feel whatever you feel and set whatever boundaries you need to set.  Sending love <3 

For real though I’m actually going to exercise and eat healthy and stop purging and restricting.
ED recovery blogs please follow me and I’ll follow back, I need support and food suggestions 

3 days bulimia free
1 day binge free 

I always told myself that if I could just make it to 135 pounds, I’d be happy. I’d stop hating myself and would feel beautiful, I thought.
I stayed up at night fantasizing about how great I’d look in a swimsuit. How I’d smile at myself in the mirror rather than painfully avoiding my reflection. How I’d BE somebody. 
Well, I finally made it to 135 pounds. And I feel exactly the same.
Fuck you, bulimia. Fuck you for planting yourself so deep inside me that even when I think I’ve rid myself of you, you’re still here. You’ll always be here to tell me I need to lose another 20, suck in a little more, keep my head down so people don’t have to look at the fat girl.
Fuck you, bulimia.

I just want to be skinny 

I’ll have been in active recovery for nine months.That’s as long as it takes to grow a baby.In my mind right now, I’m envisioning a little recovery baby, all wrapped up in blankets, who’s finally out of the protection of the womb and ready to face the real world, but who desperately needs me to take care of her.Don’t worry, little recovery babe. I’ll protect you and feed you and love you. I may not do it perfectly, but I will do my best. (Holy shit, you guys. Has it really, REALLY been that long?)

I think I’m getting worse again but I don’t know what to do. I have my pregnancy to think about. I’m so messed up. 
“not pro only using tags”Bitch who you tryin to fool?  
 
I need helpFor every like / reblog I will fast for one hour 
Reason #1593I want to recover to be there for my friends the way they have been there for me  
Hey! Summer is coming up and its easier to binge more than ever since I’m home alone all the time, and I’m sure many of you feel the same. I’m looking for an Ana or a Mia buddy, to help keep me in check and keep me competitive since im trying to lose around 40 lb this summer. If you meet some of the all of the stuff and even some of the stuff on this list, hmu! -have an ed (required)-live with your parents (makes it hard to purge/fast/etc.) -goal weight is 100-110 lb -forced to eat lots of meals you dont want to -can text on an iphone (msg me for my #) -willing to become friends/talk about other stuff besides ed sometimes (talk about interests and stuff) -pro-recovery  
💀 This was me 10 years ago. I was 27 lbs from my lowest weight. My goal is to get back down to this size and weight. 💀 
My ribs are #Ana but haven’t told my stomach yet lmao 
things to remember:- there is nothing shameful about being hungry (even when your mind tells you you “shouldn’t” be)- there is nothing shameful about listening to your body (even if it feels like you are doing something wrong)- do not compare what your body needs to what other people are eating, they are not you - you always have permission to eat more 
I PROMISE YOU THAT EATING BECOMES EASIER BY EATING 
my unhealthy obsession with jojo mixes well with my unhealthy lifestyle.  
The middle of recovery is awful. It does not feel good. There are moments where it will be clear why you are doing this, ones that will take your breath away. But a majority of the time you will question everything, your thoughts will be racing so much that you will feel like you can’t breathe. You will spend countless days wondering why things can’t be quiet, wondering why you are bothering to work so hard when not fighting would be effortless. Recovery does not feel good. If you are looking around you and are ashamed because you are not in love with this process, please, listen to me. Take a deep breath- It’s okay. It’s okay to hate it. It’s okay to say it sucks. It’s okay to want to give up, to struggle immensely, to be angry, to be uncomfortable (you should be!). and it’s okay to not understand why your smile still feels empty when your stomach is full again. Recovery does not feel good. For goodness sake, I hate it!!! Do not mistake my positivity for perfection. I am not walking through this fire gracefully. I burn and fall and become ashes. And every morning I rise and face the flames over and over again. So please, do not beat yourself up if you are feeling like a failure for not being happy and perfect. Healing is not linear. And you are still brave.

I mean, accurate. 

something that’s stuck with meseeing people recovered on instagram. and not ‘recovered’, but actually embracing how they look and eating freely — cake, pizza, ice cream, yet also salads, fruits, veggies.they’re proof that recovery is REAL and that it’s WORTH IT.if recovery wasn’t worth it like your eating disorder tells you, then why have these people stayed recovered when they could have gone back? why would they not return to their eating disorder if it was as shit as our ed’s tell us?because it isn’t. it’s worth it, and these people are proof. proof that you can succeed without it, proof that you can be happy without it, proof that you DON’T NEED IT. 

You deserve to recover..• if you were never hospitalised• if you still get your period• if you were never technically underweight• if you still ate every day (yes sweetie, you’re still valid)• if you don’t think you’re sick enough (I promise darling, you are)• if you’re underweight, a normal weight, overweight.Anyone and everyone deserves recovery, and you’ll get there one day, I promise ❤️ 

 

it’s raining outside and i can’t stop thinking about how much of my life i’ve devoted to making myself unhappy. how many times i’ve said no to things that might make me smile. how many times i’ve looked in a mirror and pinched my skin, begging it to become empty space. how many nights i’ve torn myself apart for not being enough, for being too much, for being. how many years i’ve shattered my own heart because it felt like what i deserved. i was wrong. i have had terrible things done to me, but i don’t have to be like the people who did them. i’m allowed to be happy. i’m allowed to take care of myself.i was wrong. i deserve to be okay. and please, pause for a moment and think - there’s a chance you might be wrong too.  

What sucks so much about having crazy distorted body image is one moment I’ll be like “I am literally the finest, hottest creature on the planet” but within half a second I’m suddenly the most disgusting, repulsive piece of flesh ever to walk to earth and there is literally NO IN BETWEEN. 

their highest weight might be your lowest weight, and that is okay. your eating disorder is just as serious, and your recovery is just as valid.

FATS ARE FRIENDS! 

You deserve to eat and nothing is wrong with feeding your body the nutrients it needs. 

My entire treatment team: you are very sickMe:Originally posted by dwyer-and-recreation 

Words from my therapist that I’ll never forget 

Your family does not care what size your jeans areYour family does not care if you can fit a hand between your thighsYour family does not care to count how many bones are protruding from your bruised, breaking skinYour family does not see you only as a number on the scale. Your mum is just relieved to see you healthy againYour dad is happy to see the light back in your eyesYour brother is excited he doesn’t have to pull as much hair out of the shower drainYour sisters can’t wait to take you out shopping or dancing or eating againYour grandparents love that your young bones are no longer as fragile as their older onesYour friends are so excited that you want to go out with them againAnd you. You will be vibrant again. You will be able to live and see beyond the numbers on the scale, the constant, obsessive body checking, the calories and fat content. You will see the beauty and the joy. You deserve that. Fight for that.  

Being healthy isn’t about eating nothing but salads, fruits, veggies, etc. It’s about those days where you decide to say “screw it” and eat pizza, french fries, chocolate, etc, and then the next day decide to eat a bit better. It’s not depriving your body of what it needs, as well as what you want, but having balance.﻿

Trying to educate people who assume that all eating disorders directly result in specific body types 

ok ok but ya know what i’m realizing?? HAVING AN EATING DISORDER IS SUCH A WASTE OF MY LIFE. in the time I devote to my ED, how many more people could I help?? how many more laughs could I have? how many more breathless moments could I experience? how many beautiful runs could I go on? how much of the patriarchy could i crush?? I AM JUST DONE. THIS IS NOT WHAT I WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR. THIS IS NOT WHO I AM. I CANNOT CHANGE THE WORLD WHILE HAVING AN EATING DISORDER 

Some of you have never had an eating disorder or a body image disorder and it really shows 

the media: look at this poor girl. she starves herself so she has some form of control in her life. her eating disorder in no way has anything to do with her actual body and how she looks-tumblr anas: nêêd the skinnï  

 

Quick reminderYou don’t have to prove you’re sick by losing weight. Chances are, the people that love you already know that something’s not okay and there’s no need to make the situation worse. Reach out to people, they care. 

- Your ED is lying to you- Losing more weight will not make you love yourself more- Losing weight will not make the people around you love you any more than what they already do- Eating normally again will truly make you feel better physically and mentally- Weight loss does not cure a negative body image.  And long as you continue to have a negative view of yourself, you will never like how you look, no matter how much weight you lose. 

Honestly, what is the worst that could happen? What is the worst possible thing that could come from trying? from giving it a go? from pushing your ‘comfort zone’? Surely it is worth trying, worth seeing and worth experiencing first-hand? Rather than always wishing and wondering? Fearing and worrying? Theorising and catastrophising?Staying trapped in the endless overthinking/analysing, that leaves you stuck in the same monotonous cycles day in and day out.No, it is not going to be easy, but nobody said that it would be. Change takes time; old habits die hard. But that does not mean that they are unbreakable or that it is not worth trying.Who knows? You could surprise yourself.It might not be as terrible as you first thought it would be after all. And it could just be the very thing that you need at this moment in time.The reality is that if you never try, you will never know;and if you never know, you will always be wonder. What if? 

literally anyone: oh wow !! you look so pretty and h E a L t H y haha good job !! me:  

Turning to your eating disorder when you’re going through a hard time won’t make things easier for you. It’s not going to solve your problems and you’re not going to be happier just because you’re feeding into the disordered thoughts.  

🖤 

PSA 🌸 LADIES/LADDIES/AND NON-BINARY PALSLISTEN THE FUCK UPif you are having chest pains, dizzy spells, severe hunger nausea, spotty vision, heart palpitationsyou ! need ! to ! eat ! it does not have to be a full meal! but PLEASE eat something— you could be experiencing hypoglycemia, which is extremely dangerous and ana’s are particularly prone to due to extensive periods of fasting/severe calorie restrictioneat something with CARBS & SUGAR to get those blood sugars back up. energy gels are a quick and easy way to do this. I know we all want to lose weight, but please be safe and take care of yourself— if you are going to restrict/fast, please try to reduce harm to yourself as much as possibleI love this community so much. please take care of yourselves, and please always know that you can reach out to me if you need to talk. 🌸  

Your body’s response when you treat it right (LOVE THIS!) 

So I was reminding myself to stay away from triggering content on here and I casually had the thought “it’ll make you sicker and you are already sick enough.” My ED has spent years yelling at me about how I’m not “sick enough” to actually have an eating disorder, to actually have a real problem, to go to treatment, to ask for support, to deserve the help I’m getting, etc. I have at times been so convinced me that no matter how deep I am in my disorder, I’m never really sick, I’m never “sick enough.” A lot of people who have struggled with ED’s understand this line of thought. So you might then understand how totally taken aback I was to have the thought “you are already sick enough” without consciously trying to fight the ED or reappraise thoughts. Reminder to everyone that you and your feelings and your illness are valid. If you are even questioning if you’re sick, and if you’re having doubts that you’re not sick enough, you absolutely deserve help. You don’t deserve to feel sick at all, and you definitely don’t deserve to feel like you should be “sicker”….weaker, in more pain, suffering more, etc. I hope the inner compassionate voice that showed up for me tonight (for the first time in a long time) shows up for you too <3 

Truth. 

For my fellow anorexic sufferers…Perhaps you see the end point and the weak, emaciated forms at the end of this lonely road and you think that you are not a “successful” or “good” anorexic unless you reach rock bottom, and reach this level of bodily harm. Until people are afraid and concerned for your wellbeing upon looking at you, the delicate flower. Trust me when I say that there is no delicate flower matter about it. But I can promise you that the end of this road and the desire to be sicker shows just how much of a grip this disease has on your mind. The desire to “prove” ones self by becoming this ill is a testament to the damage that has been done by this disorder on your thought processes. I know because I was there, and AM there still as I pull myself free from the death grip this disease has on me.  Friends, this life is so very short. Will you be happy to come to the end of it realizing you wasted it with these toxic thoughts and feelings, having destroyed yourself day by day to come to the inevitable conclusion that you know deep down you will find? Will you be glad to have squandered your time this way? Break free of the chains of ANY eating disorder no matter what stage you are at… and live. I wanna hear good news from you. Now go out there and start.  

 

If you are in recovery PLEASE don’t compare your daily intake to other people on here who are also in recovery!  A lot of the “recovery meal plans” I’ve seen in the tags are still pretty small.  It can be triggering to see the tiny portions other people are eating.  Don’t worry if your meals are bigger, or if you eat more snacks throughout the day!  Everyone’s recovery plan is a little different, and it’s important that you are following a diet that is most suitable to YOUR needs 

Discharging treatment only to relapse almost immediately 

Am I underweight? Nope.Does that mean I don’t deserve to recover? Also nope.

Realities of having a restrictive ED-you won’t like yourself at your goal weight-you might even hate yourself more-living will feel like hell-you wont be able to stay at your goal weight-boys wont like you more when you’re thinner-no one but you will notice those 1-2 pounds you gain from letting yourself eat-youre not “too far gone” to recover-youre not “not sick enough” to recover-your family will be heartbroken seeing you getting sadder and sadder and weaker and weaker-you wont let yourself do those things you said youd do once you lose weight-your personality will start being taken over by being sad and sick-youll get sick of everyone worrying about you -your grades will drop and youll lose friends-your safe foods will start boring you-youll always be cold-people around you might not notice-youll shit every two weeks-if you b/p youll end up barfing everything you eat no matter if you want to or not at some point. no matter where, when or what.-your life will become more miserable the more weight you lose -itll take years away from you-treatment can be hell but is worth it-recovering requires a lot of hard work-the ed community is too used to only seeing thinspo pictures from the most “flattering angles” of malnourished people-almost everyone alive will have a bit if flab. its skin. thats how we just are as a species physically and theres nothing you can do but accept it.-you will lose control over time-you deserve recovery as much as much as others-being fat or ugly doesn’t make people less important than being thin or pretty 

Suicide Prevention Month day 1: IT GETS BETTER.
The first picture is of me at age seven, which is when I first began to experience suicidal ideation. I had severe depression/anxiety/PTSD as a result of abuse from my biological family, and my desire to die stemmed from that. Looking back, it is horrifically tragic that I wanted to kill myself at such a young age –but at the time (and in the many years that followed), my death wish felt perfectly rational. After all, for my whole life, things had only gotten worse as far as my family’s treatment of me and my emotional state. By the time I was 19 and left my biological family, I had been suicidal for over a decade, and had actually attempted more than once. And even once I was free from the abuse, things were STILL bad – I was on my own in the world with no family to fall back on or come home to, I was struggling to get proper medical treatments and work/pay bills, and I wanted to die more than ever. At this point, it felt like I had every reason to give up and end it all, because never in my life had things ever gotten much “better”. I thought I had every reason to kill myself – but there was one big thing stopping me: hope. 
Even in my absolute worst moments, when no other person was there for me, I had my hope. I had the little voice inside of me that whispered “keep going”, and the tiny flicker of light that refused to be overpowered by the overwhelming dark. I had my hope, and nothing could take that away from me. So I held on to that small flame, and fanned it until it became a raging fire. I reached out to friends and professionals for support, I advocated for myself, and I fought like hell against everything in the world and in my mind that wanted to hold me back. When depression shouted at me to kill myself, I shouted even louder that I was going to keep living. Even with shaking hands and tears in my eyes, I stood up and pressed onward because deep down, I had faith that one day, it would get better – and get better it did.
The second picture is of me today. Today, where I still struggle at times, but am no longer suicidal. I no longer want to die, because despite everything that ever held me down, I finally built a life that I would consider 100% worth living. Things finally began to look up for me, even in the face of everything bad I had been through. A couple of months ago, a friend I reached out to put me in contact with a really amazing couple, who talked about adopting me into their family – and shortly after, that discussion became a reality when I moved to California to be with them. Not long after arriving here, I got the puppy I’d always wanted (to go along with the safe, loving family I’d dreamed of) and started seeing a very skilled therapist to work on the things I still struggle with. Soon, I will be starting college classes and taking music lessons to pursue the things I’m really passionate about. Overall, my life is full of love and joy, and I would not trade it for the world. 
And the thing is, none of this would have happened if I had not kept living. None of this would have been possible had I at any point gone all the way and actually killed myself. Had that happened, I would have been dead, and my story would have gotten that tragic ending instead of the happy one it has now. I guess what I am getting at here in this novel of a post is that IT GETS BETTER, but in order for that to happen, you have to LIVE. So please, if you are struggling with suicidal thoughts, do not give in. There IS hope, and a there IS light at the end of the tunnel. All you have to do is keep fighting in order to get there. 💙 

 

Relapses do not make you weak. It is okay. Recovery is not linear. You will heal from this and you will be back on your feet in no time. Treat yourself with gentle words and careful touch. Be kind. Relapses are tough but so are you. You will make it through this. 💕 

Me, after being in highly intensive treatment for over two weeks 

I don’t know how many of/if any of my followers are Jewish, but for anyone observing Yom Kippur and in ED recovery right now:Please eat. Don’t let anyone make you feel guilty for eating (This goes for everyone in ED recovery actually!)Eating on Yom Kippur is not a reflection of  who you are as a Jew. You’re supposed to live by the commandments, not die by them.I know this is the Day of Atonement, but please don’t let it feed into any struggles you may already have with guilt, self criticism, feeling overly responsible for others, feelings of worthlessness, feeling like you’re not enough, feeling like you’re too much, or any other cruel thoughts your mental illness sends towards you.Taking care of yourself is an important part of Tzedek and Tikkun Olam. You have to heal yourself before you can heal the world.  

I came to these tags looking for positivity and support. I sure as shit don’t want to know about your safe foods, nor do I want to want to hear about your weight loss progress, nor do I want to see your thinspo.Just fucking stop. 

You know you’re really working recovery when you still eat when it hurts the very most 

feelin real good lately 

I’m scared to see a therapist because:I might get diagnosed with some serious stuff, and I don’t want those labels on meI might not get diagnosed with anything and then I would feel like a whiny lil bitch 

“We cannot control life by controlling what we eat.” - Nigella Lawson 

note to self: it’s ok to snack late at night  

 

so I told my mom that I wanted ice cream earlier (especially since I had already eaten very little today so I was super hungry). she then went to the store and bought ice cream. I told her not to (because it’s a fear food) but she did anyway.after crying a bunch, I ate the whole little cup. granted it had a bunch of calories and it really freaked me out, I managed to make it through. I’m trying not to let the guilt sink in too much, especially since its almost 1am and I have no idea what we’re eating tomorrow but oh well. I’ll live, right? Haha well that was my little recovery win: eating Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from blue bunny 💛😊

Challenging the Anorexic Path of Thought, and Self Conscious Thinking.I believe this is something that we all think- whether suffering from an eating disorder or not. A friend today told me about how she felt everyone was staring at her, judging her, looking at her with disdain because of bloating and weight gain. That her presence was one that made people stop and shake their heads at? That she was on the outside, and there was something she wasn’t getting…   If you’re someone who likes to hear brutal honesty, then this post is for you:    Nobody cares. Like, they’re busy doing they’re own shit. They do not care even a tiny bit if you’re pale or if you’re bloated or curvy or a skeleton they don’t notice and they don’t care. They dont.      No seriously think about it. They’re living their lives and doing their own things and going to class and thinking about their last text you are not and never will be anyone’s main focus when you walk by if you are bloated.      Their lives are not interrupted at all. they are okay and living and will continue to live… it’s only you who isn’t living. It’s just you that’s not living your life over it. They will never think on it deeply like you do.      When you see a girl do you notice her thighs first and stomach? If she has a curvy butt do you care at all? How do you react? Omg stop my life? They don’t notice anyone but themselves either. And if they look at you they are not looking at you as critically as you do. They may say, oh she has nice skin. And move on. They are not going to be like “I see a tummy so she’s a bad person gtfo off the planetAND! AND! AND! when people make those little comments like, oh you gained weight, they are not putting it into perspective, analysis and judging you as a person and your moral credibility. They’re observing a universal fact that has NO bearing on you as a person and they will likely move on to do something else and not pay their comment a second thought at all. They’ll forget it.       I said I would show them all when I lost the weight… But really, what will it do? If you prove that you can be sick as hell? What will showing a couple of people that you’re sick do? It’ll waste your time when you could be LIVING They are not worth killing yourself to prove a point. Either way they’re gonna go back to their lives anyway it doesn’t affect them it just kills youCHOOSE LIFE. CHOOSE RECOVERY. Xoxo, Lara 😙😘😚💖 

I feel like one thing that isnt talked about near enough is that your mental health directly impacts your physical health and vice versa.This is one of the reason that they’re both very important. Extreme and prolonged stress can cause chronic headaches, fatigue, and even stomach ulcers, to name a few things. Eating disorders can cause heart problems. Depression can cause aches through your whole body, fatigue, and can just make you feel sick. Chronic illness can cause depression and anxiety. And so it goes. They directly effect each other.When you’re caring for your physical health, even just by having a regular sleep schedule and eating enough, you’re caring for your mental health. When you care for your mental health by taking breaks, talking to friends about your problems, and just by taking time to meditate, you’re caring for your physical health. They aren’t separate from each other. You have one body and it’s very intertwined with your mind. Helping one will help the other, and vice versa. So take care of yourself, alright? You deserve to feel good.  

The sickness is not in your new lowest weight or a confirmed diagnosis. The sickness is in the way you’re abusing your body and believe that it’s okay. 

The curves on my body are proof I am enjoying my life. With every party, every cake, i’m learning to love my life again. Every curve is a reminder of how good my times were. A reminder of how good they will be.

Why starve yourself when you can have amazing hair instead? 

Listen, you deserve to be happy. No matter who you are, where you’re from, what you’ve done in the past, and where you’re headed tomorrow - happiness is for all, including you ✨ 

💗 please don’t be mad at your body 💗💗 it’s doing its best 💗 

shoutout to ppl with:-very round tums-tums that roll when you sit or bend over-tums that always have rolls-tums with cellulite or stretch marks-tums with large rib cages -tums that have outtie belly buttons-tums that have innie belly buttons-tums that sit over your pants just a wee bit-tums with scars that are either from self-harm or an operation/surgery of some sortyour tummy is cute and very important and there is no need to be ever be ashamed of it.   

Friendly reminder (mostly to myself) that you have a whole bunch of organs n shit all snuggled up inside your abdomen and losing more weight isn’t gonna make them go away!!  Your stomach can’t always be perfectly flat!  Having bumps and pouches on your tummy is literally part of normal human anatomy please don’t be mad at yourself if you can’t have a smooth/flat stomach! 

But i decided to tell my mom, officially, that i had an eating disorder. It scared the unicorns out of me, but i did it and i’m honestly super relieved and glad i got it off my chest. i thought she was going to cry, like i was doing, and it severely broke my heart, but just knowing she was there to listen and help.. it meant a lot. guys, if you’re struggling between telling your parents, or anyone, that you have an eating disorder or fear you may have one, this is your sign to tell them. don’t hesitate.you deserve to live, to be happy, to recover.  

You’re gonna have bad days and it’s okay. If you’re having a bad day please don’t give up.  

Your now is not your forever.-John Green  

{ maybe tw } So as of today, i’m officially diagnosed with anorexia. i was told by the dr. that if i dont increase my calorie intake in 2 weeks, i’ll most likely have to be put inpatient. i wont lie, i’m extremely scared for this all. but maybe i’ll really get better..  

 

Don’t get involved with someone who:Belittles you Brings you downDoesn’t respect youPressures you into doing things Shows signs of being manipulative Doesn’t pay attention to what you say Laughs at the things you take interest in Doesn’t take your feelings into considerationTalks with you primarily when they want somethingYou deserve someone who treats you with compassion, love, and respect. Don’t settle for less.  

A Tale Of Horror: Always Double CheckI was at a little anime store in our mall browsing the snacks section to find some low calorie snacks. I picked up an instant bowl of Udon noodles and it said one whole bowl was just 70 calories. I bought them that second, rushed home and cooked them up. As I took the first two bites, I was scanning it into the MyFitnessPal barcode reader to place it in as my food for the day. And there it was½ bowl = 1 serving. 250 cal per serving. Servings per container: 2I spit everything that was in my mouth out almost instantly and I was set into full on panic mode.I looked up the company and the noodles name and their nutrition information added up with what MyFitnessPal said. The box clearly had 70 cal per serving on it. I thought I was going insane. But the truth is they lied on the packaging.Lying about nutritional information on packaging is very illegal. And mentally devastating to someone with ED. Please be weary.  

Now that our community is getting shut down- and our accounts- I decided to make an ana discord for all of us.It is friendly to pro-recovery and pro-Ana’s, and each room is separate so you don’t have to worry about seeing things you don’t want to see!Ie: If you’re pro-recovery/in recovery you can choose to have the role: Pro-Recovery and you’ll unlock the pro recovery chats, but you wont be able to see or talk in the pro ana chats. Anything Triggering or considered “glamorization” or “promoting” is all in the ‘Pro-Ana’ chats and there are general rules of what you can and cant post, not matter your roles.There is also a general chat that everyone can message in.There are a few requirements to join this discord and they are as follows1. Must be 13 and older2. Must have an eating disorder (anorexia, bulimia, BED, EDNOS, etc)3. You can be male or female4. Must DM me first on hereIf you have any questions and/or would like to join, message me! I’m accepting anyone and looking for 5 admins.  





it’s crazy how much of a difference you can make to your body in such a short space of time.
2 months(ish) difference - 135lbs to 115lbs - 5`7 🍀
/ now to build lean ass muscle, forget about the scales & tone that shit up. 💥 

That is a HUGE accomplishment!! I’m so proud of you! Keep fighting and honor yourself for those successes <3 

 

The main reason I’m writing this are cause I really appreciate it when other people bring this up but it still isn’t talked about enough! EDs are glamorized so much, and only recently have begun to be properly represented. So here we go, here are my personal messed up experiences - crying when trying to find fancy dresses to galas and grad cause there was nothing pretty in my size and then once I lost weight crying because I still felt I looked ugly in the dresses- binging on my little sister’s halloween candy- feeling like all I do is waste my (and my parents) money because when I buy a nice dinner for myself and have a night alone, that dinner will end up flushed down the toilet - feeling like the girl I like is lying to me every time she calls me beautiful or hot- having my little 8 year old sister walk into me purging and watching her cry and ask what I was doing as she saw me with my hand down my fricking throat - my mom crying and asking what went wrong and why I have no control, why I can’t diet like a regular person - trying to awkwardly wash my hands and fix my makeup cause I’m at school but just couldn’t resist purging that dumb 300 cal starbucks drink which my friend had bought me and brought with the happiest smile - trying my best not to breakdown when someone makes an anorexia/bulimic joke - constantly smelling like puke - clogging the pipes at home and knowing that its all my fault- losing over 30lbs and still seeing myself exactly the same every time I look in the mirror because gotta love developing body dysmorphia - trying not to cry and breakdown whenever someone I haven’t seen in a while asks how I lost weight but rather have to swallow my tears, smile and laugh and say eating healthy and exercise-my hands are constantly cold and shaking (as I’m writing this rn)- feeling like I’m fake and don’t have an eating disorder- I get headaches so often - my grades dropping because I can never focus, remember anything, or I spend too much time and energy thinking about food and how I’m going to exercise instead of paying attention in class- dancing for 3 hours after not eating for 3 days and feeling like I was going to pass out, and in a really messed up way lowkey loving that -feeling a sense of accomplishment sometimes when I could see and mainly feel how sick I was getting - spending hours concealing the dark sunken bags I’ve developed under my eyes- not eating anything all day because I have plans at night which I know will involve eating- avoiding fear foods like crazy, before 2 weeks ago I hadn’t had pizza in over 3 months and a burger in over 5 months because I was so scared I’d purge them- insecurities about my body growing to insecurities on how I talk and act and therefore constantly trying to get people to like me - knowing the amount of calories in different brands of the same foods - staying up till 3am looking at thinspo and meanspo and hating how I look while crying my eyes out, wishing I had more self control- not being able to sleep because I can’t stop shaking or I’m getting hunger pains which hurt so much - literally crying over the toilet with my throat feeling raw, knuckles red, and feeling like a complete failure, guilty for all the people I let downI’m stopping there because the list seems too long but it only goes on. Please I beg, if you’re still new GET OUT and if you’ve dealt with the same then please please please consider recovery, I know it seems scary and awful for some but I promise it’s so so worth it. 💕 

holy SHIT recovery has done me so damn good!!!! i love myself so much i’m crying 


                — 
                no one is going to save you            


Recover because …You want to have a future. Instead of hating yourself while engaging in ed behaviors, you can learn to love yourself. Of course it isn’t easy, and you might hate the way your body feels or starts to look, but you’ll learn to be at peace with yourself someday, instead of running in the same circles. Maybe some day you want children. I don’t want to damage my body anymore destroy myself to the point where having kids might not be an option some day. You’re going to have to eat as long as you’re living so you might as well learn to enjoy it again bc food is social, tasty, and brings people together. So you don’t spend the rest of your life worrying about calories, and what you are having to eat next - if anything at all. Your body is depending on you to feed it. Your body is home and deserves some kindness. Some day, if not today, you’re going to feel so sick of being at war with your mind. It’s time to make peace. You want to enjoy holidays with family and friends. So you can eat lots of turkey, and desserts, or whatever you please without feeling like you have to punish yourself. Measuring your worth has nothing to do with numbers on a scale or the size of your clothes. Your worth should be measured on the things that actually matter - like how you treat others, what kind of work you do, and who you are. If you don’t choose now, it’s never going to get easier. Right now if you’re engaging in ed behaviors, you’re not living. And if you’re not living - you’re dying and that’s no way to envision a future for yourself. ^ these are some things that I am telling myself now as recovery is feeling more challenging today than the last few days. I’m looking for the silver lining.  

When I stand up to my eating disorder by deciding not to act on a behavior, but the eating disorder retaliates by suggesting a different behavior 

I may no longer be a size zero, and my bones no longer stick out. But I’m beautiful. More so than ever. Because skinny for me looked like death. Pale, sunken, dry. It wasn’t pretty. The last time I saw my family doctor she took my height and weight. When she calculated my bmi she turned to me and said “Sam this is the way you are supposed to look”. She told me how proud of me she is and how much more life I have in me. Now this women knows very little about eating disorders and doesn’t understand them at all. So she didn’t know that that’s exactly what I needed to hear. She is just an outsider that truly believes that my most beautiful self is when I’m healthy.I’m learning to accept and love myself. Everyday I’m getting one step closer to that goal.💕  

recovery feels so fucking good

                memoirs from a relapse            


I ate chocolate today. I have gained some weight but that’s okay because I have also gained the strength to accept what I see in the mirror. Even though I ate chocolate today. 

When a friend of a friend is saying inaccurate, stereotypical, insulting things about people with eating disorders but I don’t feel comfortable calling them on their bullshit because drama could ensue and I hate conflict 

Fresh faced and *happily* full of pizza 🍕
 

Messages to those struggling with an Eating Disorder from someone in recovery***disclaimer that I am in no way a professional therapist. I am simply speaking from my own experience with ED recovery and struggling with an eating disorder***-I’m so proud of you for being here. I’m proud of you for staying strong. I’m proud of you for being alive. I love you-it doesn’t matter how much weight you have or haven’t lost, if you are hurting your body you are hurting it period. You don’t need to lose a specific amount of weight to have an eating disorder. It is classified as a MENTAL disorder for a reason. You are valid no matter what and just because someone’s disorder may look “worse” than yours doesn’t mean yours isn’t bad. I don’t care what you say, you are VALID.-you deserve recovery no matter what. You hear me? NO MATTER WHAT.-If you say you “haven’t been sick long enough” Nonono you can recover whenever. WHENEVER! Eating disorders aren’t linear. You don’t have to be sick for a certain amount of time to considered “officially sick”. There is no “time spent suffering” requirement. You could be damaging yourself as soon as you start engaging in behaviors. You are valid and you deserve to get help whether it started weeks ago or years ago.-If a doctor says you can’thave an eating disorder because you aren’t underweight go to another doctor. Fuck them. Fuck anyone who says that to you. That’s not true at all. Throughout my whole eating disorder I never once looked sick. I was never once underweight. But I was so sick mentally. Please don’t let anyone tell you those horrible things. It’s just not true and doctors and psychologists have proven that it’s not true. -Your disorder is still valid even if no one sees it. I see it. I hear you. I’ve been there. You are still valid no matter what. You still deserve help. I love you.-No, you aren’t the only one these rules DON’T apply to. Even if you don’t believe it, this applies to you.-No matter what mistakes or failures you have made in your life, you never deserve to hurt yourself. -You will NOT be nothing without your disorder. You have amazing characteristics that are just being masked by the disorder. If you were to recover, you would find new amazing passions and skills you never even knew you had. You will not be nothing without your disorder. You will be everything. -Recovery is so scary and so hard, it means facing your worst fears. Believe me I know. But once you get over that initial hurdle and start healing mentally and physically, it gets easier. I swear 100% it gets easier. Your life gets better. You feel alive again. You feel free. You feel liberated. You feel like you could dance in a field of wildflowers. -For most people, eating disorders develop because you don’t want to face the pain and trauma in your life so you use it as a coping skill to numb yourself. And once you realize that it can make recovery even more scary. Will I be in even more pain? What do I do if it becomes too much to deal with? I promise you that facing your pain is a lot less scary than it seems. Yes it is hard and heartbreaking and terrible. But destroying yourself with a disorder isn’t going to fix it, it isn’t going to make that pain go away. Temporarily yes, but it will always be there until you face it. Your disorder isn’t helping you. It’s going to hurt you even more than you’re already hurting.-Relapses will happen, even if you’ve been in recovery for years. BUT, they do NOT mean your progress has been erased. You have hit a speed bump not a road block. And you will be strong enough to get through it. I believe in you.-When you have an eating disorder you miss out on life. I don’t remember anything good about my life last year. All I can remember is counting calories, crying, and purging. You deserve to enjoy life. You deserve all the good things in life. You don’t deserve to suffer at all. -Your eating disorder will do nothing but hurt you and destroy you, it makes you miserable and sad. Skinny doesn’t equal happy no matter what! I promise you it doesn’t. You wanna know what does make you happy? Eating ice cream with friends. Enjoying the taste of chocolate. Being able to go out to eat and not have to google the menu beforehand. Not having to count calories every single day and night. Not crying over food. Being able to enjoy living and not constantly destroying yourself. No matter who you are, you never deserve an eating disorder. Even if you feel like you do, even if you feel like a failure or disgusting or a loser. You will NEVER EVER deserve that disorder as a punishment. You wanna know what is disgusting? The disorder. You wanna know who’s beautiful and strong and amazing? YOU. Please never ever forget that.  -Recovery is possible and always an option, and you will always always deserve it. 

Someday, you’re going to realize the worst is over, and the life you’ve built is beautiful. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but SOMEDAY. And it will be so, so wonderful.

                This is the strongest and best decision I’ve ever made in my entire life            


LOW CAL CHIPS (25 CHIPS  ONLY 90 CAL!)Cut one slice of Flatout Original Flatbread into 25 pieces. (Each chip is about 3 calories)Brush a bit of water into the top rather than oil so the seasonings stick. You can use any seasonings of your choice, but I like a little garlic powder, some chili powder, paprika and salt.Preheat your oven to 350F and let them cook for about 15-30 minutes and there you go! Low cal chips!

Also I need to gain back some damn weight because I’m starting to look like a Muppet 


 

One of the biggest and most ground breaking things I’ve learned so far in recovery is that no one can do it for you. Sure, you can have the support of family, friends, therapists, and treatment teams. You can have it all but if you don’t have the will to fight, recovery won’t happen. Motivation can waver day to day and hell, hour to hour but you can’t get well just because everyone in your life is pushing you in that direction. You have to show up for your appointments. You have to consciously make the decision to be persistent in recovering minute by minute. You must chose to eat more even if it feels scary. You must choose to put the razor blade down. You must choose to not purge when your mind is screaming “get it out”. You must actively choose to rest when disordered exercise thoughts are convincing you to lace up your shoes and run. I think this realization is the piece I’ve been missing. I have so much help and support it’s amazing and overwhelming yet no matter how much loved ones try to encourage me, they are not the one that has to choose to fight, to choose to go to war with my mind every day. I will actively have to make so many choices to get better and honestly, the thoughts and positive choices become automatic the more they are practiced. Keep choosing. Keep fighting. You can do this!  

Friends and family who aren’t super educated about eating disorders, but still love me enough to make a strong effort to support me 

you guys, i wish all of us could meet up and have a tea party in a sunny field❣️eat fruits , sandwiches and tea cakes and give each other compliments all day.  

If you are in recovery or even thinking about recovery, please close this blog! This Tumblr can absolutely be triggering and even though I myself am not in recovery or interested in it right now, I support you and want to make sure that I’m not getting in the way of your greatness! My tags are used to get my content out to a wider audience and if you ever want someone to talk to about your recovery thoughts please don’t hesitate to message me and I will try to be as helpful as possible. And don’t hesitate to reblog this too so your followers know you’re on their side! 

Trigger WarningEating disorder: Well well well it seems as though you’re progressing in treatment fairly smoothlyMe: Yes indeed I might even be discharging soon if–Eating disorder: It’d be a shameMe: Oh shitEating disorder: If you were toMe: DON’T YOU DAREEating disorder: Have a hysterical screaming fit in your therapist’s office insisting that they’re just making you fat here and you’d rather step on Legos than eat like a normal personMe: GO FUCK YOURSELFEating disorder: Annnnddd you just said that out loud to your therapistMe: DAMNIT 

Some days you crave salad and do for a long walk in the park. Others you do not work at all and crave cheesecake. Neither days are a waste and should be looked at in a negative way. Life involves eating a wide variety of foods and enjoying a wide range of experiences. Do not let how much you have exercised or how many calories determines the worth or value of your day.  

Me, noticing how much money I’ve saved by not eating Originally posted by awsucker 

I AM GOING TO RECOVERITS GOING TO BE LONG AND HARD BUT I WILL, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, MAKE SURE THIS IS THE LAST TIME THIS EVER HAPPENS TO ME 

Recovery from an eating disorder doesn’t demand perfection, but it’s normal to feel unsure about slips and struggles. It’s normal to question yourself and your actions, and wonder, “Is this my eating disorder talking, or is this really the best choice for me?”It’s also OK to lean on the support of others & ask for help if you’re unsure if you can trust your thoughts/behaviors. Stressing over every choice regarding food, exercise, etc is temporary, and it will get easier to trust your intuition with time. 

when ur over a day of fasting and can’t remember if u ate or not  

Just because I’m going out to dinner tonight and to a restaurant that serves large portions and calorically dense food does not mean I have to restrict throughout the day to “earn” that meal. 
Not today, Ana 😋
 

GUESS WHO JUST ATE A WHOLE SANDWICH IN A PUBLIC PLACE WITHOUT LEAVING ANY SCRAPS EVEN THOUGH EVERY FIBER OF HER BEING WAS DETERMINED TO RESTRICT? 
THIS BRAVE ASS BITCH!

Where’s my trophy and million dollar prize?? 

So i saw another counselor today. It was super weird and hard. Mainly hard because she asked some specific questions that the other lady hadn’t brought up. I’m supposed to go back to her sometime soon, but i’m not sure if i’ll continue because she makes me slightly uncomfortable.  

LOW CAL SPICY SNACK Hello! Do you want a spicy snack?30 whole wheat saltine crackers are 80 calSriracha (& most hot sauces) are 0 calenjoy úwù(38 crackers is 100 calories!)(188 crackers is 500 calories!)(375 crackers is 1000 calories!) 



A lil sunburn and a lil acne but we’re thriving in this beautiful weather 🌼 feeling really good and confident today!   

 

Still at it, So much anticipation and nervousness now that I’m facing more full blown recovery, Some girls maintain a low weight after they recover, if I wanted to do that id have to continue on in this way… anticipating the weight gain, anticipating the change… Xoxo, Lara 😘😗😙😚 

 

You don’t have to relapse to validate your pain. 

Me when I go against my therapists’ advice and end up more mentally unstable than I was in the first place
 

In nutrition appointment Dietitian: It’s very important that you take it easy and refrain from physical activityMe: Yes of course that makes absolute perfect sense I will heed your advice 100000%In unsupervised apartment that eveningEating disorder: You know what’d be super fun? Aggressive yoga 

For me eating carbs is too difficult rn, i will eat more fish, meat and eggs(and fruit and vegetables).It’s even better than not eating at all….right? 

How much do you REALLY burn?Later today I am going to be posting how many calories a specific exercise routine burns and debunking a lot of misconceptions with my new “fitbit” (it’s a knock off but good quality!)I’m 126.0 lbs & 5’5” If you’re curious to see how many calories an exercise routine burns just send them in my way!Let’s put the pedal to the test and see just how much metal we’re peddling, if you catch my drift!  

Self care is not weighing yourself after eating 4oz of turkey and 5 pierogis, regardless of what your disordered brain wants. 

pissed because i’m hungry (how dare my body require fuel?)pissed because i’m pissed that i’m hungry.recovery is hard. 

Hello!!! I conquered dinner and it was delish. 
Anorexia can fuck off. 
I’d rather eat and fight thoughts of guilt than hate myself for not eating and caving into the disorder 👊🏼

                Just Facts            


internship is awesome. i seriously love it and find it super fulfilling. i love my staff placement. i’m basically working with spreadsheets and incoming mail and donations and whatnot. it’s pretty cool to see the ins and outs of a major organizationlife is…less than awesome. if i didn’t have the internship and the community i’ve made here, i honestly think i would be in a pit of depression and anxiety. because i can already feel the depression sinking in, and the anxiety is honestly a little out of control.i’ve been having panic attacks nearly every day (every other day), which leave me exhausted and depressed. therapy is really good, and i’m working hard. but the hard work makes everyday life more difficult because it’s hard to function when thinking about all the deep stuff all the time, if that makes sense?i miss my family and friends so much. that hasn’t gotten any easier, really. i still crave the comfort of the eating disorder while in this new situation. transitions are hard. i miss the numbness. i miss the not feeling, not caring, not giving a shit if i lived or died. but i have to believe that this life is worth living. that my life is worth something.want to know anything else? just ask! :) 

I did more than “survive” Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. 
I didn’t walk through the day like a zombie. I didn’t dread my existence. I didn’t dread the food or company for once. 
Aspects of the holiday itself did bring up certain emotions and difficulties for me, but I’m still standing. 
I did truly enjoy myself and time with loved ones. I even enjoyed traditional powdered pecan cookies my grandmother used to make for me as a kid, the seven fishes (an Italian tradition) and even several helpings of cheese and crackers and whatever I was offered. 
Despite eating “more” than usual or even differently than my typical day to day does not mean I have to restrict today. It doesn’t mean I can’t enjoy more holiday treats or honor cravings to compensate for the holiday. 
I treated myself to a strawberry donut today bc they’re my favorite and it looked good at the moment. 
I am totally allowed to have this even though I allowed my self to enjoy food at Christmas. It’s more than ok! 

 

Struggle of the day #2Someone spoke to my class today about joint replacements and showed us a hip bone. A girl said ‘are those the bones at the top of my legs that stick out when I lie down?’ 

When my dietitian gives me my first meal plan (TW: Restricting)Dietitian: *hands me paper outlining meal plan*Me/ED Voice: *scans meal plan* Okay okay so this is good let’s put a pin in this…but hey how about instead I just live off of tea and popcorn like, forever?  

Maybe you’re not exactly where you want to be, but you are so much farther from where you were when you started this journey. You are so much stronger and you have learned so much. Never give up the fight. 

“Then I’ll only have more love to hold in my arms.”- My girlfriend when I told her how scared I was of gaining weight,I love this woman so much! 

I broke some some ed rules today and didn’t measure my oats, almond milk or the amount of peanut butter 😋 
I always convinced myself that measuring my oats etc. for these jars was just to get the proportions right but honestly, it tastes good no matter what the oat/milk ratio is and the more PB the better 🙈 
Wishing you all a happy Friday and a great weekend! Can’t wait to update you guys after the race tomorrow. I’m having a ton of carbs tonight - pasta, bread and a salad for dinner to get my energy intake up!  

Reason #1576I want to recover because I’m 4 years and 9 month purge free today xxx 

DUDE I don’t want to say that your parents are awful, but they sound absolutely AWFUL and totally un-supportive. I can totally see how telling them would be a bad idea. I highly suggest that you reach out to advisers at NEDA for help, because I’m by no means a medical professional. I do empathize with you though <3 I’m so sorry this is such a hard time for you. Hang in there. 

someone seeing me consume excessive amounts of food I usually never touch: Aw Look at you!!! Recovering from your eating disorderLOL no bitch, this IS my eating disorder.  

why am i punishing my body? it didn’t do anything wrong. my body keeps me alive, let’s me move, helps me grow. and i decided to deprive it of energy, to hurt it, starve it? i don’t know. i think about recovery more and more lately.  

Update and taking a break (TW)So I wound up binging really bad again tonight. I probably wound up having about 4,500 for the day. Most of which was candy and ice cream. I’ve found myself become fixated on dieting and food lately which is causing me to binge. This is the third binge this week. This is not good bye forever but I need some time to step away from social media and refocus myslef on finding a balance bewreen restrictionists and binges.  

5 good things that happened today 🌺🌿07/05/19had a great meeting with my school counsellor where i talked about loads of good things besides eating ate three whole meals!!!! and a snack!!!!!!!!!!!(!!!!!!!)took lots of photos with my friendsfelt confident in my body for once ??! got really good feedback from my teachers after worrying i had failed a test i did  

Happy four months of relapse-free recovery to me ✨By no means has it been easy getting to where I am today. I’m not where I want to be yet, not even close, but I am so grateful for the journey I am on. I am four months closer to freedom and happieness.  



Normal person, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                Ah yes indeed that was quite tasty.                    

Me, after eating dirt pudding:
                                                DID Y'ALL JUST SEE THAT AMAZING FEAT I JUST PULLED? I DESERVE A METAL. I AM A FUCKING WARRIOR GODDESS. I AM LITERALLY THE MOST BADASS PERSON WHO EVER LIVED.                    



Today is been such a productive day.I’ve done a 30 minutes workout, i’ve read a lot of pages of a book that i was ignoring since february and i’ve played the piano and the ukulele for an hour.I should study a little, but I’m already proud.Oh and i’ve not forgot to take my meds! 

Maybe we/I should make one?  Is anyone else interested in this? 

I didn’t walk to the train like I usually do. 
I didn’t walk home from the train either. I asked my mom to pick me up bc I had laundry to do and wanted to spend my night relaxing and binging tv bc that’s totally ok. 
I skipped the opportunity to exercise. 
Did my head fight me on it? Of course. 
Not walking home broke my routine, and didn’t allow me to “burn enough calories” to be able to have dinner - but I did. 
I chose to have tonight to focus on me, to clean my room, and lay down and be lazy and you know what? A lazy night is ok!
Eating disorders can be drill sargents; loud, commanding, and orderly and part of fighting the disorder and recovering is trying to break away from rigid habits and behaviors. 
I’ve always struggled with exercise addiction and focusing on exercise to burn enough calories to somehow “allow me” to eat or to create a big enough deficit to makeup for eating. 
Not tonight, Ana 🙅🏻‍♀️
 

I wish someone would’ve told me that losing weight was an addiction before I started 

❄️Reasons To Recover❄️#28To NOT almost pass out once a week or more 

Dear Pro-Ana/Mia and Thinspo Blogs…Do you think that suffering is beauty?Eating disorders kill someone every 62 minutes.2/10 people suffering from ED will die as a result of their disorder.Is this beauty?If you’re still not convinced, I’d love to show you the damage that ED can do.Because of my ED…I feel faint 90% of the time.I have had bleeding in my esophagus.My hair thinned and even fell out at one point.My nails are brittle and break all the time.Certain foods now make me sick.My fingers have scars on them from purging.My periods are extremely irregular.At one point, my ED was so severe that I didn’t have the strength to walk or get out of bed. I ended up having to be force fed. It almost took my life.Now please tell me how that’s beautiful.Exactly… It is not beautiful at all.Now stop romanticizing and encouraging eating disorders. 

 

~ Update ~My weekend felt like a glimpse into my life when I fully recovery from my eating disorder. I had pizza and cake at a work party on Friday. I went to two holiday parties Saturday night and ate several mozeralla sticks on my own and didn’t think twice about them! I had several glasses of wine (which may have made eating easier) but I literally ate a full meal at a Hanukkah party and then a full meal at a Christmas party afterwards and some of the dessert 😬 Yesterday I had three meals, and went for ice cream with a friend. Everything felt so normal and good and nice. Yes, my mind was panicking a little and worried about how to make up for it, but the overall freedom I felt to eat whatever and to keep eating if I pleased felt so amazing!! Today has been a bit harder bc it’s Monday and I’m back to my routine. Restriction has been tempting but I keep reminding myself that I’ll only be delaying a happier future the more I engage. 

my period has made me eat more no surprise!!…I’m gonna start skipping lunch and replacing it w/ fruit and caffeine to lose the weight I’ve gained when it’s over.In other news I ran a 5K today woo!! No clue how much it burned but i’m proud I did it anyway :) Gonna do another one next weekStay safe <3 

i’m struggling… 

Me, cooking for others while I’m fastingOriginally posted by replayy-swag 

✨Ana Rules✨Y’all wanna lose some weight? Here’s how I lose weight: 1. ALWAYS EAT AT OR UNDER YOUR CALORIE LIMIT. NO EXCUSES. 2. Burn off 1000 more calories than you ate for the day. Example: if you ate 500 calories (my limit), you MUST burn AT LEAST 1,500 for the day. Work out if you must to be able to obtain this3. Allow yourself one day a week to eat like a normal fucking person. Tbh I still have a hard time with this, but I’m working on it. My “cheat” day is Saturday. I’m mostly with family and friends that day and I don’t want them to be aware of my ED, so this one day helps a lot with that. Also, keeping your metabolism on its toes helps boost it. If you must, allow two days a week for this “cheat” day. Slowly work down to one day. Note: THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BINGE. THAT WILL NOT HELP YOU PHYSCALLY OR MENTALLY. DON’T BINGE 4. Fast when you can. I typically do Fasting Fridays™️ because I’m alone all day. They do not have to be super long fasts, but skipping lunch and then eating a healthy and filling dinner will always feel like a well deserved treat compared to stuffing your face at three meals and not two. Note again: THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BINGE. HAVE SOME CONTROL AND THEN YOU’LL BE AT YOUR GW 5. EAT BREAKFAST. I cannot stress this enough. This has saved me from lunch time binges and from passing out sooooo many times. Even if it is just a banana, that is still better than nothing. Personally, I prefer oats with a dash of cinnamon to keep my hunger at bay and to give my morning metabolism a little boost6. Water. Drink it. Drink at least 2-3 bottles a day. Cold water. It helps speed shit up and everyone loves that Crip™️ feeling on an empty stomach. Also, drink a whole bottle before you go to sleep. You’ll pee a lot at night (releasing those nasty toxins) and feel better in the morning  7. S L E E P. YOU NEED THAT SHIT. There have been wayyy too many studies that say getting your 8hrs of rest will boost your metabolism, keep your energy levels up, etc. and we all know we need that a lot. Please get some beauty sleep. If you want to look delicate, you need to go to bed on time and wake up on time. It’s not that hard8. G R E E N  T E A. Need I say more? DISCLAIMER: Yeah I’ve got an ED. No I don’t support them. This is a coping thing. It’s more of a reference for me to go back to later. However, these are safe-ish ways to lose weight. The best way to lose weight though is by eating less than you burn a day, getting a good nights rest, working out, eating good healthy foods, and drinking plenty of water. Most adults should be eating around 2,000 calories per day. You should also be burning that much (if not more) per day. Please note that if you are someone with an ED, or if you know someone with one, please reach out and get help for yourself or them. Trust me, you don’t want to keep living like this. It’s so tiring. It’s painful. Please look into recovery and put some effort into it. Trust me, it’s worth it. Been there done that. It was hard but the years I spent recovered were nothing but bliss. Trauma brought me back here, but you can get out. Stay safe. GET HELP. GET OUT. STAY SAFE.  

The struggle bus is so real. Insomnia is still not solved because we’re waiting for results of a DNA swab to find the right medications because my psychiatrist doesn’t want to put me on anything I don’t need to be on because she knows I hate just loading up on meds, and I’m weary. I also can’t sleep because I’ve been in the bathroom the past 3 weeks non-stop every night because I’ve been eating a lot more and feeling actual hunger cues so I’m trying to honor them but then that’s all I do is feel nauseas and shit my brains out and it’s literally like having the worst stomach flu every night or after every significant meal or even if I don’t eat my stomach hurts so I’m confused as all hell. I had a major breakdown this week. Trying to dig myself out of a depression spiral. My family has been…trying to say the least, and not to mention the ADHD is so fucking raging I’m constantly either forced to disassociate or sleep because I can’t fucking focus and take the random mind and body shenanigans. Oh and also had a total freaky weird nightmare all night about sex orgies that we’re definitely not consensual on my end and then another one where I was pregnant and hahaha the thought of pregnancy makes me wanna disappear into the void, because I have SEVERE  almost a phobia of being pregnant and it makes me feel all kinds of different feelings and emotions not all negative and scary, but those are the majority. And yeah my antidepressants aren’t working and my psychiatrist also isn’t paying attention when I’m saying my anxiety is fine I need help with depression and adhd things so that’s also frustrating but I get she wants me to sleep but also I WISH I COULD SLEEP WHO CAN SLEEP WHEN THEYRE A) SICK and B) having horrible body bursts of energy and mind shenanigans? UGH! It’s just frustrating and I’m sad and angry and upset and I’m trying so desperately to remain positive because my best friend needs me and my cat needs me and you know what I wanna live for the small stupid things as everyone calls them and I just UGH. U G H, come on positivity bug bite me in the ass again…well maybe not the ass.  

Eating disorder nostalgia is a thing and it sucks 

Me literally every day for about two months after leaving treatment 

It is absolutely exhausting to go through life hating yourself. To over analyze everything you do, think, feel. To replay and beat yourself up over moments that seem so significant but in reality, can’t be remembered in weeks, months, and years to come. How can we live a prosperous, healthy, and happy life if we spend so much time drowning in our own misery? How many times will I have to chose recovery and a better life before it finally sticks? I challenge all of you to let go of whatever mental illness(es) or shackles that are holding you down - kepeing you trapped in your old ways. This year, I want to let go of my perfectionism, my eating disorder, and work on my anxiety and OCD. 🌼 I want to bloom in 2019. Don’t you? 🌼 

it will passyou will be happyit will passyou will be happyit WILL passyou WILL be happyit MUST passyou MUST be happyit will passyou will be happy 

It is ok to eat candy!It is ok to enjoy candy!It is ok not to eat candy…but try to listen to the real you, not your disorder, and if you want candy, try to take that step to eat some and enjoy it! You deserve it and it is so so okay to eat and like things that taste good! That being said this can be a triggering time, especially for those who struggle with bingeing. Take good care of yourself and be gentle with you!!! Feel free to message me if you need to talk to someone.It can also be isolating to be struggling/experiencing fear/anxiety around something while everyone around you is celebrating and partying and excited. It is ok to struggle sometimes. You are not alone!Happy Halloween!!!  

Me: *knows my ed is stupid and I don’t need to lose weight to be happy, healthy, or attractive*Also me: I wan be a stic  

Thoughts I have to remind myself that not every day is a war. My plate isn‘t a battlefield and my body is no villain. It isn’t okay to eat unhealthy because I will eat healthy the next few days - it’s okay to eat unhealthy because I am human and I love to eat pizza. It’s okay because two bananas and three chocolate chips aren’t a binge which I have to erase with a following day of eating less. This way of living, the constant thought about what I eat and how I can reach my goal just to eat more and try it the next day again isn’t normal. It’s not healthy and I don’t deserve this. Nobody deserves this. I have to remind myself that I am allowed to relax. Not just for today but forever. It seems unreal but I am allowed to end this battle in my head just by ending it. Today, My thoughts are stopping me from letting them go- but i hope that someday I am able to leave the battlefield.  

eating disorders are hellI feel controlled when I don’t eat, and completely out of control when I do. It’s like there’s no freedom. You just choose your prison.  

Words to live by.
Grounded For Life S1:E11 

God, Could You Hurry?Every single day, I binge. I wake up thinking, “no more. I can do this.” And then it happens, I start. I know God brings me to it & He’ll bring me through it but, could He move it along a bit? No seriously, do you ever want to rush Him? All jokes aside, for real. 

Petition to stop calling food ‘safe’ food. Let’s call them easy food or something else instead. They are not ‘safe’ if they are preventing you from trying new things and breaking away from your eating disorder, they simply make eating more a little less hard sometimes. Food you may find difficult is not ‘unsafe’ either, and calling ‘easy’ food ‘safe’ only encourages this assocation and fear of eating certain things. So yes, petition to stop calling certain things ‘safe’ food, because the only thing thats going to make ‘unsafe’ food is a harmful bacteria or allergy. 

i’m told that recovering from an eating disorder is brave. to eat despite the insidious voice telling you not to is an act of power, one that many will never understand.so why does it feel so wrong? 

Perfection isn’t something to be obtained. 
You were born a Perfect you. 
All that needs to be obtained is the confidence to shine. 

hating your body is so pointless if you think about it  

Major recovery win for me today!!! 
This salad may look harmless, but the last time I had a salad from this place, I was in a very bad and destructive headspace. After having it the first time, I immediately threw it up. I am not one to purge in that way so it was v unusal for me. I have avoided salads from this particular place in fear of being triggered (though my coworkers order from there often and always ask if I want anything). 
Today, I am serving for jury duty and we were dismissed for lunch and I decided to give this another try. 
I’m not sure what about salads from this place specifically that give me a hard time mentally, but I felt really badly after. The key is that I finished it, didn’t purge it, and went shopping as a distraction since I have so much time to kill! Haha. 
I actually bought some boot socks for my new bean boots. The socks I wore today were comfy for one foot and not the other bc apparently my right foot is a whole half size bigger?!?!?? Weird. 
Tonight, I am still going to participate in a pint party and I think I’m going to try for a full fat Ben and Jerry’s??? I have been into halo top mainly bc the calories are less daunting but I love Ben and Jerry’s. So I want to try it out 😊
Anyway - here’s lunch with an unsweetened green tea 😋

Recovery anecdote #6Today the new pants that I ordered came in the mail. After trying them on I decided to go through the stack of jeans that I had to throw those out that definitely don’t fit anymore. There was one pair that I bought last year when I was at my lightest ever and I remember telling myself that I am gonna get them a size too big so they will still fit when I get better. They used to be so loose on me.I am better: they don’t fit. They are tiny, it is sad and scary that they ever fit me or were lose on me. I thought these pants not fitting would crush me, but it didn’t: it reminded to never go back. 

This is the first time in awhile that I’ve felt guilt for eating something and its super weird. Please send positive messages or pictures of your pets xx 

Reason #1463I want to recover to remind myself that it is ok to outgrow old habits, even when they are people 

dirty mirror, I already seen it  

You don’t climb the mountain without first doing the groundwork. That’s what I’m telling myself today. There are challenges I’m facing daily as well as daily opportunities for skill implementation, for dialectic thinking and for anguish and hope to coexist side by side. One doesn’t become skilled in climbing a mountain without innumerable attempts, practices and falls on smaller mountains, rugged terrain and rocky valleys. In preparation for a mountain climb you train at different intensities, different altitudes, different terrains. What you learn through that equips you with the skills needed to challenge and meet your goal. Through every practice run you learn, through every fall you get back up and for every discouragement there is an encouragement. I’m learning that what I do today impacts on what I’ll be able to do tomorrow- not because the intention to achieve the goal won’t be there tomorrow but the skill level may not. Learning to sit with the seemingly ‘little’ things to prepare for all there is yet to achieve 🏔 

✨ We live in a world that glamorizes and glorifies diet culture. There is this need to be thin to be considered beautiful and successful. We shame those who eat full fat foods and don’t avoid carbs and those who choose fast foods over a salad. We spend too much time and energy worrying about posting the “right” picture that our followers will find acceptable and deem worthy of likes. There’s so much time spent on self-comparison and measuring our own self worth against another. 
✨ I ask myself why should my successes and worthiness be determined by numbers? By how much I weigh? By how many calories I eat? By how many steps I take or miles I run or by how many calories I burn running myself quite literally into the ground? Does that measure self-worth? Do these numbers and “achievements” determine which graduate schools will accept me, who my friends are, and if my co-workers think I do a good enough job? 
✨ So why do we spend so much time trying to prove ourselves to others when the only judge that matters is how we feel about who we are at the end of the day? 
✨ I’ve spent entirely too much of my life giving into diet culture and societies standards of beauty. I’ve spent the last year and a half trying to repair the damage of done to my body and mind because of my eating disorder and all of the anxiety and depression that comes with it. Miracles don’t happen in a year and a half. I’ve celebrated both victories and have cried over relapses. I continue to choose to fight each day because I am a warrior. 
✨ I am celebrating three months of recovery; three months of wins and triumphs. I am celebrating pushing through all of the horrible thoughts and feelings that come along with recovering. I am celebrating owning up to my demons, taking responsibility, and continuing to make changes. I am celebrating asking for help and support and not giving up on myself. I am celebrating those who’ve not given up on me no matter how difficult and unpleasant I am to be around on my bad days. 
✨ Today I am celebrating me and my life because my life is worth living.  

Do you ever get seconds just to flex on your eating disorder? 

🌼 it’s meeee. Sorry for the inactivity I promise I’m alive! I’ll try to post an update tonight 🌼
 

Finally! I’m back! I was sick for like a week and a half and then I was struggling with some depression and not sleeping well or too long with caused a lot of fatigue. I’m behind in schoolwork but my professors are understanding and so I’m going to do my best to finish a bunch of assignments by Sunday night. :) I’m a little lacking on eating I was doing so good and then I got sick and the fear of choking came back so I got to try and get over that again. :( it’s just been mashed potatoes and soup for the past week and a half which sucks because I finally have a taste for food and like get excited to eat, although I am still working on getting over if a food is deemed healthy and of course if I think about it for way too long I wanna download all the apps to track. But I know that’s not consistent and I’m very much adopting a eat till you feel full and filled but not stuffed or overstarved feeling. Good news the past 4 days I’ve been trying to start a habit of good skincare and dental hygiene because those are the things that lack when I’m depressed/sick/fatigued and it helps with my ADHD when I have a plan and schedule and I’ve always failed on keeping up with it after 2 days and I’ve made it 4 days! :) so that’s exciting because I just feel better in the morning and at night and it helps wake myself or let me know it’s time to rest (even if I don’t fall asleep fast I’m still in bed, which is a win because adhd keeps me up at night doing weird shit) I’m thinking of starting my adderall tomorrow and I’m nervous because I hate new medication and different feelings because it can upset anxiety plus my psychiatrist was like you must eat before taking it so there’s that “double edged sword” of anxiety. I may wait till Monday after I talk with my therapist about it because she usually eases my anxiety! Another good news is that I left the house the other day, yippee! And I saw the BTS movie with my friend and it was good! I’ve been a fan since 2014 and it was cool to see and hear their thoughts and actions while on tour or about their music or the fans! They’re really well spoken about what they’re passionate about and I love that about them! :) Tomorrow is homework, cleaning, and I may go up to the little craft fair with my mom to check it out! :)  

Today has been a tough one. A real tough one. 3 hours of broken sleep when I struggle on less than 8. My emotions have been overwhelmed, physically I’ve struggled with food and mentally I’ve been a mess. I asked all visitors not to come and just struggled from the get to. Here’s to hoping tomorrow is a better day.. 

🍪🍪🍪Holy shit. Soooo way back when things started getting bad with my eating disorder in college, I found myself binging on cookies in the dining hall. They had a warm cookie bar and I would literally eat so much of it and then purge it all in the bathroom right after. It was a horrible cycle and I haven’t touched warmed cookies since. One of my coworkers just got a box of warm cookies delivered to work and I was so resistant to have one. I was afraid that surpressed feelings would resurface. They have. I want to purge so badly. So so bad. The cookie was good. I tried my best to just have it and be normal and fit in. Now my coworker wants to buy us all lunch - fried chicken. That’s what I planned on having tonight. Why is today so hard!!! I’m going to do it. I’m going to have the fried sandwich. I had the cookie. I had a breakfast sandwich. I’m going to be ok. I am recovering to get my damn life back. These horrible feelings need to go bc I am allowed to join in with my friends and eat what I want! 

From February 26 - March 3rd, it is National Eating Disorders Awareness Week.Eating disorders are deadly. They are not fashionable. They are not useful. They are not kind.  It can affect anyone no matter what age, size, race, class, sexuality, or gender.More than 30 million people in the United States struggle with one or more eating disorders.I am openly telling the world wide web that I am one of those people.I have starved myself empty. I have binged myself full. I have purged myself into the emergency room. There is a list of rules in my head that I have followed on and off for about five years now. Countless numbers have their own personal file in my brain, whether that be how many calories are in a harmless snack, or how many sit ups it takes to burn it off. I have tricked my body into not being hungry and I have gone to bed numerous nights with my stomach begging for anything that could help it feel not so empty. Water, green tea, coffee, and gum can take up so much of my time. It is a constant battle between my body and my brain. I believe sometimes that I will get better, and I do for a little while, but something hits the switch and I crawl back into that hole of emptiness that I was in before. It is so dangerous to feel this way. But if you’re reading this, and you can relate to any of it, you know you’re not alone. You have so many people who share your frustrations. Your fears. Your anxieties. You are able to recover. I am able to recover. It is a scary world we live in where no matter who you are, you are told you’re not anyone’s first pick unless you are a certain size or certain figure. There are constant reminders of what you should look like everywhere you go. This kind of world is corrupt, and the only way to change it is for you to look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself - “I am beautiful. I am worth more. I have value because I am human. I do not need to look any different to be loved, desired, or respected. I am enough.”  By doing this, and truly making that effort to change your mindset so that you believe it, you are fighting back what has hurt you for so long. Healing is in no way linear, and you may catch yourself slipping once you feel even the slightest bit good about yourself. But keep going. We are stories still going. We are too valuable to be lost by something so cruel. Keep your head above water. For me, for you, and for everyone who wasn’t able to help themselves before it was too late. You are enough.

 

Reminder: Anyone who really cares about you doesn’t mind one bit when your body changes. Keep recovering. You got this! ❤️ 

Reason #1417I want to recover to wear myself confidently and not feel like I have to apologise for it 

Happy HalloweenHey recovery warriors… I’m struggling big time today. This time last year I was in residential treatment for my eating disorder and I feel like I have no support right now. I keep reaching out to my family and therapists for support but I feel like it’s not enough. I’m using symptoms again and i feel awful about it. I took advantage of feeling naseaus due to my med to not eat and it quickly escalated. I need some support friends! 

A question for my fellow babes: To all my fellow babes, ((I hate calling you followers. How LAME is that)) whether here for recovery, fashion, advice or other fun. Go ahead and let me know what it is you would like to see me do as of the new year. It would seem that everybody is trying to reinvent themselves. Everybody is trying to redo themselves after the events of 2017. The truth is, you can’t reinvent yourself just like that. It takes a whole change of perspective. It takes practice. It takes discipline and time to recover just like it took time to fall into the pit of anxiety, your disorder, or whatever it is that has Afflicted you.I’d like to have some different segments on the blog centered around YOU all. I want to throw more of those big tumblr slumbr parties! We all connect via perhaps Skype, and watch videos together and spend time caring for ourselves. If you’re lonely on a Friday night, we all have a worldwide party. I’d like to answer more questions from you all and hear about your struggles, endeavors, and recent developments! I’d like to have other segments where we all come together and thread an idea, make a story or create an alternate reality for a day! Let me know what you want to see !

                A poem for you.            


Eating disorders fuck with your sense of right and wrong so much. 

HeyI’m doing a lot better. Making good strides to breaking my relapse. Thank you for all of the support it helped a lot !!! 

70/100: got myself some cute things for Easter 🐣🌸🐰
Todays work wasn’t study related. It was recovery related. Family events are always stressful and very hard for dealing with my eating disorder especially after having such a horrible body image day yesterday. My eating disorder has definitely caught up with me during the last days and I am very glad to be able to talk to my psychologist next week and work more on my recovery. 

Does anyone else’s eating disorders go from 0-60?!?I woke up in a great mood with positive intentions. This morning I felt on top of the world, like I could tackle anything anorexia threw at me. I set goals for fitness and health and food in positive recovery terms. I tackled breakfast. I smashed my morning snack. Lunch came around and I lost my mind. I had chicken and some green beans and got a coconut milk latte as a pick me up. I’ve fought every urge to purge. It took me 50 mins to find the will to sip my latte. Now it’s in the trash. I hate how quickly the tables turn; how fast the negative thoughts can flood in and take over. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. But some how I have to stay strong. How difficult when the tables turn so quickly and all motivation gets thrown out the window. How fast.  





Big big fear food challenge: bakery goods without knowing and counting calories. White bread, cheese, sugar and sweet sauces.. All of this screams don’t eat it.
BUT GUESS WHAT ANA, I DID 🐝✨ 

When I actually try to eat “normally” someone always comments on my weight and how “skinny” I’ve gotten and I regret eating. 

hi i’m cady and this is my friend trout and this is your sign it’s a good time to recover! 

Literally curled up in a ball on the floor because I ate more than I intended to. Struggle town. I feel like I’m gaining. Which should be good but I’m terrified.  

”Refeeding syndrome is a syndrome consisting of metabolic disturbances that occur as a result of reinstitution of nutrition to patients who are starved or severely malnourished. The syndrome was first described after World War II in Americans who, held by the Japanese as prisoners of war, had become malnourished during captivity and who were then released to the care of United States personnel in the Philippines.Any individual who has had negligible nutrient intake for more than 5 consecutive days is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to feed. Patients can develop fluid and electrolyte disorders, especially hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.”From wikipedia (link).In other words, refeeding syndrome is a dangerous but rare syndrome that people in early recovery are in risk of developing. It is not chronic, and it is treatable, but it can be deadly. It is a reaction to an increased calorie intake after starvation. Risk of refeeding syndrome is why people in recovery gradually increase their intake. People who are in especially high risk of refeeding syndrome are those who are or have;- very underweight- severely/undernourished malnourished- have gone without food for more than 5 days- have been purgeing- rapid weight loss In other words, if you are obese and have starved yourself and lost a lot of weight rapidly, you are also in high risk. It is not just something that happen to persons with severe anorexia.Some of the symptoms are;- lethargy/fatigue- dizziness- edema (if you experience severe edema, which is water weight gain/fluid retention/swelling, seek medical care asap)- rapid/irregular pulse- shortness of breath- muscle weakness - electrolyte imbalance- weakness- seizure- paresthesia (a sensation of tingling, tickling, prickling, pricking, or burning of a person’s skin)- muscle contractions- altered mental state - thrombocytopenia (decrease of platelets in blood)- bleeding- abdominal pain and problems such as diarrhea or constipation- low blood pressure- irregular heart beats- nausea- loss of appetite- paralysis- hypokalemiaRemember that many of these are normal symptoms. In recovery I experienced fatigue, dizziness, edema, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite, but I did not have refeeding syndrome. We often say that if you feel very unwell in early recovery when you increase your intake, seek immediate medical care. You are not in risk when you have been in recovery and eaten enough for a while. I think risk of refeeding syndrome is a good reason not to relapse, but it is never a good reason not to recover. Like mentioned, refeeding syndrome is rare. You are much more likely to die of your eating disorder than from recovery. Not choosing recovery is the most dangerous thing you can do.- Amalie 

i actually hate my body, i have for a long time and it’s gotten so much worse. i’m trying to recover and eat right but i feel like i’ve given up. i don’t have control of hardly anything anymore and my eating has always been something i can take ahold of. i feel like i should be working harder, wasting away. i feel like someone needs to notice my pain but i don’t have the words to say anything. i’m so empty. everything i cared about in the previous months seems like it’s been replaced by my relapse into obsessive eating. i’m not drinking my mugwort tea, i’m only drinking green tea and apple cider vinegar. i’m not looking at pictures of cute dogs and pretty tarot decks, i’m looking at ways to eat healthy and lose weight. i’m spending my time waiting for my next perfect meal, not looking forward to anything and not getting any work done. i know i need to talk to my therapist about this but she doesn’t know me well and we’re focusing a lot on the other miraid of problems i have, between depersonalization and hallucinations and paranoia i feel like i’m bringing problems onto myself by obsessing over food again, but i don’t know what else to do. i’m sad when i don’t have control, when i’m night-eating. i feel better when i have control, either when restricting or obsessing over how healthy my food is. but it leaves me with this sense of emptiness, like i have nothing else to look forward to. i’m sad. i feel alone even though i’m not. i need to get out and do something. 

I actually love this question
I don’t have to know where the nearest bathroom is 24/7
I have so much time to think about other things now that I don’t have to know how many calories are in things
I’m awake
I get to find out what kinds of foods I like and go to the grocery store and not freak out
I can go out to lunch with friends and laugh
I can be in school
I’m alive
I’m happy
I can focus on things that make me happy instead of on nutritional value
My self worth has nothing to do with my size
I can help others on their path to recovery
I can use my voice
I can laugh at the girls who don’t want a piece of cake that someone brought in because it’s fucking delicious cake
I can eat a blueberry that a girl offers me without worrying about the calories
My hair doesn’t fall out
I don’t waste money on gym memberships and ‘health foods’ and laxatives
I’m not worried about everyone leaving me all the time, I have friends for the first time
I look alive
I am alive
I am alive
I am alive
 



S:
                                                Don't turn around, but describe the door behind you to me. Stick with me on this one.                    

Me:
                                                It's a door. It opens and closes. Locks if need be...                    

S:
                                                What did it look like? What colour is it?                    

Me:
                                                It looked like a door. Rectangular....it might have been brown?                    

S:
                                                Is it a good door?                    

Me:
                                                Well I suppose as doors go, it's not too bad.                    

S:
                                                And when we came in earlier did you take much notice of the door? Analyse it?                     

Me:
                                                No, not really.                    

S:
                                                Why not?                    

Me:
                                                Well it was just a door. It worked. I had no other reason to look any further into it.                    

S:
                                                So you wouldn't go up to it and start picking out all its faults?                    

Me:
                                                No, I don't think so                    

S:
                                                Okay, come on lets go and look at the door                     

                                                *shuffles awkwardly to said door*                    

S:
                                                So standing here, can you pick out anything wrong with the door?                    

Me:
                                                Well, I suppose there are holes where someone tried to drill something into it there, a few marks here...                    

S:
                                                Come on let's get closer to the door....what about now? Can you find more problems?                    

Me:
                                                There are more marks here and there, someone hasn't fixed this corner up too well either. Oh and there are more separate marks over there ...                    

S:
                                                So earlier when we came in the door you didn't take much notice of these things right?                     

                                                *nods*                     

                                                It was just a door that acted as it needed to and it served it's purpose right?                    

Me:
                                                Yes                    

S:
                                                So why do you think the more and the closer we looked, the more we picked out as faults?                    

Me:
                                                *shrugs*                    

S:
                                                Come on think                    

Me:
                                                Well I suppose, before, it was good enough for its purpose. We had no need to go up to it and pick out every imperfection. It did what we needed and we had no need to question that...?                    

S:
                                                As a human race we search for patterns. We seek to find anomalies. The more we look at something, the more "faults" we pick out, the more we find "wrong". We often try to eliminate these anomalies; some are better than this at others, but it is part of our nature.                     

                                                So earlier we didn't NEED to look at the door so closely did we? It didn't add to our experience or the purpose it served did it?                     

                                                It is the same with food - we do not "need" to know the minute details down to the weight in grams of a slice of bread or the amount of carbs/protein/fat it contains. It is a slice of bread. It can be toasted or used to make a sandwich by holding a filling.                    

                                                Yes the size of some pieces may differ, but what does that matter? It does not change its purpose. The closer we look at something, the more imperfections we will pick out, the more it will bother us. The slice of bread is good enough to use as we want to. Knowing the weight of the bread does not change that piece of bread or its purpose. It adds nothing; you don't need to know it, it does not matter.                    

                                                *My mind has been blown*                    



We love an awkward hand and hair that covers our breakouts 🥰🤭 

Who just overate on her meal plan? ME
Who is not going to purge? ME
Who has reached out to supports? ME
Who is going to forgive themselves? ME
Who is going to kick ED ass this weekend because a few bad days don’t mean I’ve completely relapsed? ME 

Getting used to my bigger, recovered body isn’t easy, but it has to be done 

I personally don’t think veganism is conductive to recovery. I love animals and I’m very passionate about the environment, but I strongly believe that veganism often becomes a means of restriction.Thoughts? 

What day is this?So, yeah. My eating disorder is fighting to come back into controll, but I am also fighting to be normal again. Personally, I don’t believe I’ll ever make a full recovery, but I know that I will be pretty damn close to it. Each day I want to starve myself but I still eat my once fear foods, have that little bit of chocolate to piss my ed off and sometimes enjoy my whole 90Kcal hot chocolate instead of my normal 45Kcal one.As long as I keep taking little steps, try and not log calories, everything will be fine. (I’ve been getting back into that for some reason?)No matter what I will fight for my freedom to have what I want to eat, and to enjoy it. One of these days I’ll have to bake a cake (chocolate maybe?) for myself, it’s one of my greatest fear foods and if I can overcome that I can over come anything. 



*unpaid advertisement*
It’s there😍 I ordered a snack box full of tasty surprises from The Go Foods Company. There are so many amazing snacks in there and I can’t wait to try them🐝✨💕 

Reason #1590I want to recover to fight for a kinder better world  

People out there really thinking that eating something more (“something small, something healthy”) everyday can cure an eating disorder lmaoo 

🌸🌿
 

 

Ok so.
I used to restrict. Like really restrict.
If I ate more than 200 calories on non planned eating days I would purge. I would lose about 7 pounds a week. This went on for months. I ended up having two seizures and my depression was at its worst. I knew it was time to pull myself out of it and fight these habits but I had done so much damage to my body already. It was hard to just walk. I would get dizzy and have seizure auras constantly. I couldn’t work out to get healthier..at least yet. But I knew step one was to eat and keep it down. For a few months I started to eat and stop counting calories. I gained so much weight. Then I saw a nutritionist (only about 3 times though because my insurance didn’t cover it) but she introduced me to the idea of having a healthy relationship with food (all food not just the “healthy” food). After that I began to eat and not beat myself up for what I ate. Not long after that my mood got better, my thoughts about food got healthier, I’m at my heaviest but healthiest. I’m happily choosing foods that are good for me and not because I’m following a diet. And just this month I’m finding that I am now able to fully run and exercise without the extreme dizziness or seizure auras. 
Im letting go of Ana and Mia.
And I’m so fucking proud of myself. 

Y’all I need help!!
This is what I’m wearing to my upcoming school dance
The wig looks more purple in real life but the colours are fairly similar. However the theme is “masquerade”. I want to make a mask like this:
But I don’t want that to be pink too. So I need y’all to vote for me. Do I make the mask with pastel blue and cream flowers and just a couple of dark blue ones. Or do I make it just white and cream? Helpppppp 

QUESTION, are night sweats a thing during recovery? I’ve been getting them so bad since I started treatment but I don’t know if it’s to do with ed stuff or if i should be looking into other things? 

Growing up I was always told to hide the things that make me different.  It was never acceptable to show any form of negative emotion, or to speak about the things that were bothering me. Mental illness was always a taboo subject and never accepted. It wasn’t until recently that I learned that this was incredibly unhealthy, and that I shouldn’t be afraid to speak about my recover process. 

While those around you may seem happy and healthy, you would be surprised at how many people are suffering in silence.

It is estimated that 450 million people in the world currently are suffering from at least one psychiatric disorder. This includes your neighbors, family members, friends, teachers, and anyone else that you may meet.  It doesn’t matter where you come from, your gender, your sexuality, your race, etcetera, mental illness doesn’t discriminate. It has the ability to impact anyone, and it isn’t fair for those who are struggling to do it alone. Whether you prefer to talk with someone you trust or a professional,I highly suggest that you reach out. Mental illness isn’t something to be ashamed of and don’t let someone who is ignorant or doesn’t understand convince you otherwise. Speak up about mental health and do not hide who you are.  

On recoveryAs some of you may know, I am a recovered ana.I remember [vividly] my thoughts on recovery when I was throat-deep in the ED deluge. To me, recovery was “being fat and pretending to be OK with it.”Recovery was “pretending to be OK and pressing everything down even further.”Recovery was “being a poser like society demands.”Recovery was “inconceivable unless I compromised the very fabric of my soul.”I couldn’t have been more wrong. For my ED/ana/Ednos/mia/orthorexia/etc friends and followers: maybe this post will disappear into the blr-abyss but maybe it will help someone. *disclaimer*: I am not a mental health professional, so please just look at this as peer comments. If you struggle from an ED or mental health disorder, please take steps right now to get help. Just search on tumblr and you can chat with someone who cares. My ask is always open too.I didn’t go the traditional recovery route. 1) I saw a counselor at uni who helped me marvelously. We talked about my best gf who died suddenly. We talked about fam issues and faith issues and existential issues. Almost none of them had to do with weight/BMI.2) I worked with multiple doctors, who found that I have celiac and lupus. Once those diseases got under control, my mental health SKYROCKETED. EDs have very real physiological roots. 3) I saw a highly conscious nutritionist who supported my desire to eat a plant-based vegan diet, but challenged me to do it in a healthy way, not a self-destructive way. I saw an allergist who found out why so many foods were making me sick, which made eating a pleasure again instead of painful!4) I moved out of home and followed my passion and stopped GAF what other people say about me or my looks or my wt or my life choices.5) I found my true passion: science and medicine. My obsession with counting calories and my own physiology was a misplaced fascination with science, data gathering, etc. And now, I use those powers for GOOD instead of self-destruction. 6) I refuse to participate in body-bashing or body-shaming. 7) My version of feminism: using healthy food to fuel my body and BRAIN to succeed and have the life I dream of…instead of starving and harming myself and my BRAIN.I realize that many of those above (esp 1-3) are extremely privileged. I was so blessed. However, there are many free and low-cost options. Please find a free clinic and talk to someone. If they don’t respect you, MTFO. Find a healthcare provider who listens and cares and supports your recovery.What does my life look like now?I know that some people feel that stats are triggering, but I would like to share them to disprove my pre-recovery ana brain saying “recovery=fat.” I actually love my body now [almost all the time]! I am around 172-173 cm and weigh abt 48-50 kg. While this is a low BMI, it is “normal” for most of my family members — and it is a good 5 kg higher than my LW. My periods are back and regular. My BF is low, but my muscle mass is that of an average MALE my height! During relapses, mainly because I wasn’t eating enough calories, I did experience water wt. gain and bloating. PSA: EAT!! I was so afraid of carbohydrates. I thought if I ate a whole banana my thighs would literally blow up overnight. And I thought if I ate an avocado (over 300 cal!?!?!?!) I would be obese. But now, it’s so hard to imagine I was ever someone who had to write down every single calorie eaten and burned every day. I eat *at least* one avocado a day.I don’t count calories. I eat a high carb low-ish fat vegan diet. I drink large green juices most days to start the day, and raw salads with soup during the day, and large cooked meals in the evening. My evening meals are typically something several huge bowls of brown rice topped with every vegetable you can imagine (corn, sprouts, avocado, parlsey, cilantro, arugula) and vegan cheese and black beans for fats and protein. Or, it could be half a bag of russet potatoes, oven-baked, topped again w every veg you can imagine! I exercise purely for pleasure now and for the mental health benefits, not for calories. I have had neurological issues from the lupus lately, so I haven’t been able to run, but I have enjoyed light elliptical or walking workouts. As soon as I *actually started eating carbs and enough calories*, I actually LOST weight. In a relapse/recovery period, I was about 125 lbs/57 kg. I felt very bloated and tired and puffy. BECAUSE I WASNT EATING ANY CARBS OR FOOD IN GENERAL. I was doing this whole keto vegan thing aka STARVATION. As soon as I recovered from that and started HCLF vegan, I went from 57 kg to 50 kg (125 to 110lbs), without exercising or counting calories or ANY type of dieting. Just eating until I was satisfied.My point is not to say this is a cookie cutter for everyone’s journey. My point is that you can OWN your recovery. You CAN be HAPPY AND RECOVERED.I hope this was helpful… . I hope even one person can read this and be helped by it. LOVE YOU GUYS. <3Unconventional Recovery Resources1) Natalia Rose (nutritionist — love her books)2) Eckhart Tolle (spiritual writer: The Power of Now and Stillness Speaks helped me massively transform)3) Dr. John McDougal (doctor with nutritional focus. Check out his website - it has a ton of free recipes and articles. He helped me recover from CARBOPHOBIA). 

Recovery…what a wild ride! It is impossible to gage how your experience throughout this journey will go and what it will look like. That is why I think that we all need to be compassionate with our fellow recovery warriors. Some people will reach a strong and solid state of remission with no restriction in sight and feel totally secure in themselves. Others will get their intake up but still struggle with fear foods and ED thoughts during times of stress. Some will focus on the mental more than the physical and some will go full out restoring their weight while ignoring the cognitive issues. ED’s exist on a spectrum and everyone will have a different level of challenges to address. Lets try to be respectful of that and lift each other up as a community. We are all fighting the same deadly mental illness.

Relapse has made me quiet.Relapse has made me feel guilty.Relapse has made me feel ashamed.But it has not broken me. It has not made me give up. It has not taken me down.I’m still fighting. I’m still trying. I’m still standing.I’m still here. 

Destroy the idea that women who get eating disorders are ditzy and self-absorbed  

so, i changed my url. i do not want to be my eating disorder, and I refuse to let myself be reduced to it. my recovery, my awareness work, my desires to help others - they are part of who I am. But that’s the thing: they are part of me, but not all of me. Who I am, is wild. And I am determined to embrace it.so if you need me, you can find me at embracingwild :-) 

I’m so concerned with weight gain/loss, 
When will I reach that point where it doesn’t matter? I want to skip all these struggles and get to that point. 
I want to reach what my healthy weight is after not binging or restricting. 
I want to not have purging urges. 
I want to accept my body. 
When will that happen? 

When friends talk about their body image and caloric intake around me and won’t stop even when I try to change the subject 

I’m sickSo I caught the viral that’s currently going around in my area. It’s pretty much just a stomach bug so I am pretty nauseous and hopefully I won’t throw up at all.No matter how sick I was with my ed whenever I caught something bad like this viral I would stop my diet and switch to something else.This diet is for sick people and its called B.R.A.T, it stands for banana, rice, applesauce and toast. So next time you get sick please try it, even if it’s just half a banana, or a small bit of toast. Nausea sucks, and many of you will use it not to eat, but when your sick you need food for your body to fight off the virus.Love you all and stay hydrated!—-Je suis maladeJ'ai donc attrapé le virus qui circule actuellement dans ma région.  C'est à peu près juste un mal de ventre, alors j'ai la nausée et j'espère que je ne vomirai pas du tout.Peu importe à quel point j'étais malade à cause de mon trouble de l'alimentation chaque fois que j'attrapais quelque chose de mauvais comme ce virus, j'arrêtais mon régime et je passais à autre chose.Ce régime est destiné aux personnes malades et s'appelle B.R.A.T. Il signifie banane, riz, compote de pommes et toast. La prochaine fois que vous tombez malade, essayez-le, même s'il ne s'agit que d'une demi-banane ou d'un petit toast.  Les nausées craignent, et beaucoup d'entre vous ne s'en servent pas pour manger, mais quand vous êtes malade, vous avez besoin de nourriture pour que votre corps puisse combattre le virus.Je vous aime tous, restez hydratés!(Désolé si l'un de mes Français se trompe! Je me suis beaucoup entraîné récemment, mais je ne suis pas parfait.)

Thanks you dove!
:) 

I’m curious if anyone in eating disorder recovery  with OCD has had a similar experience to me. Since becoming more active and true to my recovery, I feel like my OCD is exponentially worse than it was when I was engaging in my eating disorder. I’m on sertraline which supposed to be really good for helping OCD but I feel like the obsessive thoughts  haven’t decreased at all. Does anyone think there could be correlation between giving up ed behaviors and channeling some of that energy into OCD behaviors? Idk if that’s a thing but yeah, looking for some answers!  

If you’re not feeding yourself you’re feeding your eating disorder. 

FUCKIN KINGS AND QUEENS I STAN YOU ALL!!! I KNOW IT’S ROUGH RIGHT NOW BUT YOU’RE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS AND ALL YOUR HARD WORK IS GONNA PAY OFF!!!! KEEP GOING I LOVE YOU!!!!!!! 

LOW CAL alternatives to ice cream - Starbucks Frappuccino made with almond milk and no whip (and sugar free syrup if they have it in the desired flavor). Freeze it for a few extra minutes at home, and you can eat it with a spoon! A tall could come out to be 110-150lkcal, and a grande would be around 210-250kcal. This is less than MOST low-cal ice cream pints (and better, in my opinion. I only like, like…3 halo top/arctic zero flavors)- Smoothies! They’re so diverse, and you can put things like cocoa powder, bananas, vanilla protein powder, and PB2 in them to simulate ice cream flavors! Maybe even sprinkle coconut crisps or nuts on top. This is a lot of nutrients your body needs!!- Açaí bowls with and low sugar granola and fruits, sprinkled with a mix of PB2, cocoa powder, and your favorite sugar free sweetener! Even sugar free syrup/honey works! Amazingly good! Nutrients!!! So yummy and colorful! Indulge in your sweet tooth in a smart way to prevent binging, stay relatively low cal, and get precious nutrients. These can even be eaten as meals! Though I’d suggest supplementing your frappy freeze with some extra fruit or veggies. Stay safe, sweet babies!  

Soooo good😍✨
 

Still on that eating train…someone pls remind me this is a good thing.  

🕊 

I’m in love with these protein fluffs now (and don’t worry I also had something else for breakfast additionally)🙈

Chocolate Protein Fluff with cacao nibs *-*
And Gimli also seems to be interested in my yummy food ^^ 

Recovery Plan I will start by forcing myself to have a net cal intaje of 700 calories a day, which is terrifying. Once 700 is no longer scary and I am comfortable, I will move up to 800 and then continue adjusting to higher calories until Im at 1200 a day. I will not weigh myself at all. I will continue to exercise, but the more I exercise, the more I have to eat. This is terrifying but I know it will be worth it. Also, @daydreamingofdusk really inspired me to recover. Their blog just radiates comfort and reassurance. I reccomend anyone thinking about recovery to take a look and remember whats good for them. Im so happy to be taking steps in a new direction, away from my eating disorder. I know I can do this.  

That time I almost accidentally ran over my therapist I was biking home from work and I stopped short at a redlight and nearly ran over my ex-therapist. She was on the phone and glared at me. Then I saw the look of recognition on her face and she kept walking and kept her head turned away from me completely while she waited at the corner. She always gave me such weird bad vibes and I literally felt so gross afrer that near run in 😡 she’s one of those people who makes my stomach turn. Idk what it is about her that I find so unsettling. I always felt like she was kinda stone cold. K always gave me such a positive and warm vibe and always seemed like such actually cared about what happened to me. On the other hand, J always made me feel like the whole thing was just one big business transaction. Idk. Just so glad I never have to see her again.  





Showing my face, yeyy🙈 
this is my favorite dog of all time, he’s sadly not mine🙈 

 

Hello my loves and happy Monday! It’s been a rainy, cold few days and I don’t like it at all 🤭 I’m counting down the days til my trip to California (just planned this yesterday with my mom!). I can’t wait to wear my new bathing suit, get tan, and be in the warmth and sunshine! Nothing makes me feel better than sunny warm weather ☀️If I’m honest, I have felt really tempted to try to lose weight/get really fit before my trip because I want to look my best so I’ll have nice pictures and feel so “california”. Whatever that means. That’s really my eating disorder talking and it’s totally unwelcome. Nothing about a week trip to the opposite side of the country means that I need to alter my body. All for what? I want to be happy and healthy and be able to enjoy all of the food and drinks while I’m on vacation! Not worry about my body!! I think I wanted to incorporate that thought process because I want to make it known that sometimes you will feel the need to compare yourself or feel like you have to meet some sort of expectation that no one is holding for you but yourself. It’s unrealistic and unkind.  I took the day off from the gym as I’m exhausted from working a few weeks straight with no break. I haven’t had a sleep in day in forever and I think I might skip the gym tomorrow and have a good sleep 🥰 maybe I’ll go for a quick run and do some band work to get something in, idk. Just trying to rest up for my race and treat my body kindly! Wishing you all a happy and productive week! Feel free to inbox me with questions/entertainment. I love answering your asks! 🌸 

Random Recovery ThoughtsI was thinking the other day about how my mindset has changed over the last year. I'vr been in recovery for over a year now and my mindset has changed countless times. I went from hating myself to loving myself and back and forth over and over again. From having a passion to recover and get my life back to losing all motivation and wanting to slip back into my ed.But the change I was thinking about was the fact that even up until. a few months ago, my entire world was food. It was all I ever thought about, all I cared about. I never stopped thinking about calories and fat and weather or not I’d eaten enough vegetables that day. All I care about was food and my body/weight and I held onto as much of my ed as I could while still labeling myself as “recovering”.But the other day, I realised there are so many people on this earth that I would literally die for. I would do anything for those (animals included) I love. I went from being so consumed by my ed I never thought I’d be totally free, to caring about (many) other things so deeply I’d give my life to keep them safe.So if you are wondering weather you’ll ever be free (from your ed, anxiety, depression, any mental/physical illness, or anything that makes you feel trapped or burdened), you can be. You just have to keep fighting. Even when it feels like all hope is gone, when it feels like nothing you do makes any difference, I promise it does and it will get easier. You will be free. You will not have to feel the weight of this burden forever.  

i wonder at what weight ppl are gna stop telling me i look skinny “but still healthy”how low would i have to get for ppl to worry instead of make positive comments about my health??i was at a healthy weight before. now i’m significantly underweight. stop telling me i “look good” or “look better” and implying that my healthy body was one that needed improvement in the first place. it’s comments like that that make recovery so ridiculously hard  

Fuuck, I’m at the dr and the weighed meWhich isn’t really a trigger for me-I prefer to know where I’m at. But it’s worse than I thought, which means I really have to step up my game.I’m so confused. Why am I losing weight when I’m eating more than my ED wants me to? Why bother? 

My goals and rewardsGoal 1: 70kilos (154.3 lbs)Reward: new makeup paletteGoal 2: 65kg (143.3 lbs)Reward: get my triple forward helix pierced Goal 3: 60kg (132.3 lbs)Reward: buy some new clothes Goal 4: 55kg (121.3 lbs)Reward: get my belly button piercedGoal 5: 50kg (110.2 lbs)Reward: buy myself something hella cuteGoal 6: 45kg (99.2 lbs)Reward: throw a party (tell friends it’s “just because”)UGW: 40kg (88.2 lbs)Reward: whole new closet 😁😁 

i feel like im planning my relapse 

My first dinner in this beautiful coconut bowl was mashed broccoli with seeds, nuts and two good sauces🥦🥥 

honestly people with EDs that are less than 18 y/o make me feel like crying because of how fucked up is our societylike a kid is literally starving because everyone around them is telling them it’s good to be doing it??ED sufferers mostly start behaviours at a very young age (I’m talking about 12-16 y/o up to 20) and I’m here just hoping no kid ever will be suffering because people in their life tell them it’s good to lose weight that way for whatever fucking reasonI see thinspo and anorexia/bulimia blogs who are 13 to 15 y/ojustpleaseget out now that’s starting because when you’re this deep you won’t be able to no matter how hard you try. the more it stays with you the more it’ll want to stay with you.  

at this point i wouldn’t even care if my ed took my lifeit’s taken so much from me already so what’s a little more? i know there are people i’d leave behind that really care about me, i understand that. but i’m so tired. i’m tired of being at war with myself every day. and i don’t have the energy or the willpower to recover. i’m tired of being stuck. all i can do now is fantasize about my heart stopping.  

Thank you to everyone for all the kind messages, you’re all making recovery that much easier  

This was me… two years ago.  

How can I leave the mindset of “fuck it, I’m fat anyway?” 

So I’ve been in a residential eating disorder clinic for three weeks, after being in hospital for two weeks and I’m almost weight restored. Looks like I’m going to have to start from square one and now all eyes are on me. 

Trying to recover from an eating disorder sucks. Trying to recover from an eating disorder as an adult, after 8 years, sucks. Trying to recover from an eating disorder in an obese body sucks. It’s been a long fucking road for me, and I’m honestly not sure how much longer it will take for me to reach recovery. It feels like forever honestly. I’ve been in treatment numerous times, residential, php, iop, outpatient… and honestly, recently, recovery phases tend to last longer each time. But lapses and relapses hit me like a fucking truck. And it’s so hard to come back. I’m 28 years old. My eating disorder started my junior year of college at 20. My ed started off restrictive, followed by 6 months of restricting and b/p. Then by the end of college in turned in to restricting/binging. I’ve been diagnosed with ednos, osfed, bulimia non purging type, and BED. I went from an unhealthy low weight to an obese weight within these 8 years. My body has suffered from malnutrition, defeciences, and other weight related issues. It’s been hell. Recently though, my life has changed. I moved out of my parents house and in with my boyfriend. I own my own business that is successful. However, my anxiety, depression and eating disorder remain. They are familiar, safe. But I don’t want them. I want health. I’ll be honest. Recovery for me is tricky. It involves mental health as well as my body physically stabilizes and trending down in weight. All while not falling in to restrictive habits. I need an outlet and I decided to begin using this tumblr again to do so.    

Breakfast.. Feeling guilty now. But I’m gonna keep fighting :) 
 

 

me: today i’m gonna eat healthily. i’ll try not to binge. my ed, later the same day: 

UpdateSo, a update on how things ate going, well yesterday and before that were okay, I was definitely struggling to get my calories in, had about 950 both days, and today I didn’t count. I think I am around 1700, I pushed myself really hard!Thinking about how well today went makes me smile, I have eaten a little candy(had a sugar crash), got a sugar headache(I don’t usually eat anything with +5g sugar) I even had chicken stir fry for dinner, my favourite! My weight is a little strange right now, I am pretty bloated and my body isn’t reacting well to my low calorie days, hopefully it’ll even out soon as I try to drink more smoothies and have apple sauce or pineapple.(I actually have a sensitivity to any citres fruits, including pineapple but whatever.) 

I hate when my friends say things like “one meal isn’t going to make you put on weight” and “you’d feel better if you were getting enough nutrition” like yeah I get they’re just trying to help and are only speaking what they really think but they don’t understand what’s going on in my head. I understand one meal isn’t going to have a significant effect and that proper nutrition is important but that’s not the way my ED sees it. They don’t get why I have to go for an extra run if I eat more than I planned to. I just need them to understand the conflict I’m feeling but they won’t cause they’ve never went through something like this. It just sucks 





Yesterday’s snacks.. It was a lot but I told myself to relax and just let myself have some sweets ‘n stuff :)  

BPD awareness month, 5/6Day 6: although identity disturbances are difficult, there are things to help us have a sense of self.Mine is through my job. It is the only thing about my life that makes sense, and teaching is so much a part of who I am.However, I struggle with my identity constantly.  I often look in the mirror and question existence and who is looking back at me and if this is reality. I once brought that up to my students (while teaching Hamlet, I said “you know when you’re looking in the mirror and you’re thinking about how that’s you and you’re in this life till you die, but then you start to question your existence and if anything is real”) only to have them all give me blank stares. That was the first time (I was TWENTY NINE when that happened) I realized that wasn’t like… a thing people regularly do. Oops.Originally posted by thenatsdorf 

i feel like i’m eating too fast today and kinda mouth hungryi’m worried it’s a side effect of my new medication (remeron) and that i won’t be able to stop eating/gaining weight, which is like, obviously my biggest fear in my EDanyone have experiences with this?other potential side effects i’m noticing are sleepiness & dry mouth 



Ya gurl actually went into a changeroom for the first time in 12 months.  Recovery is a scary ass mofo. 

I will tell myself that life is beautiful until I believe it  

Even though my GW is only 20 lbs away, I don’t think I’ll hit it by July. It’s not that I won’t make that much progress, but if I’m building lean muscle from my workouts, then the number on the scale probably won’t change as much. But my measurements will. So I’m wondering if I should go by that instead? Someday I’ll be really toned and a tiny 110, but if I’m building muscle while losing weight, it’s almost like losing 40 lbs instead of 20. I don’t want to trick myself into thinking I’m not making progress when really, my goal is just farther away than I originally thought. What do you guys think?  

The day that I accept my wide bone structure is the day I truly recover.Will that ever happen? Stay tuned :“)) 

My goals ~T-eat healthier and exercise more-get happier/more motivated-recover from ednos-build healthy hygiene etc habits-get more muscular/sportive-get my grades up for my A-Levels-learn how to play the guitar-read every day-make myself a garden outside-start my own business-recover from selfharm (I’m over a year clean) and suicidal tendencies-get more organized 

Yall are gonna feel guilty when you read that i was found dead with a needle in me and im BLAMING yall in the letter!!!! (If i were to do it im speaking hypothetically)  

Got some new snacks for the following work days😊🙈
 

Not sure if I’m trying to recover or if I’m just bingeing 

Scared afThis week I finally went to see a personal trainer/dietician. I’ve been feeling like hitting a platoon, not only weight-, and foodwise, but also with working out. Seeing the weight itself was a nightmare; I’ve been consciously avoiding scales in the past few weeks, knowing that those binges are gonna show results. Well, they did. On the other hand, my results and stats regarding muscle tone and body fat were good, healthy, so theoretically that weight consists (mainly) of muscle. Objectively speaking, of course - my mind was screaming at me the whole time that normalcy is not okay, healthy is not enough.Anyway, we agreed that the goal is to lose fat, and get even more muscle tone. And for that, she set me on a 1,400 kcal intake. I’m horrified. On the one hand, I want to get healthy and fit and stay in the normal range - however, the constant whisper of “you’re not good enough to get skinny, this is just an excuse to slack off” is driving me crazy.I don’t know what to do.

My first order from Coconut Bowls arrived☺️ I got myself a natural coconut bowl and a wooden buddha spoon🙈
I really need more of these soon😍😊✨ 

I mean….
I feel attacked. 

This is so true. I very naively thought that I had flipped a magical switch in my brain and it stopped the disordered thoughts. It started last night and I took a 4.5km walk after dinner. Partially from anxiety and I’m sure subconsciously I was trying to burn calories from my day. 1310 was a scary number to see. Today I’m at about 670 before dinner and the anxiety is again high. I’ve calculated and recalculated dinner ideas in my head trying to get the lowest calories bc tonight my anxious number is 900. Fuck my brain is a mess. Operation be less of an asshole to my body is much harder today  

Confessing my ice cream addiction.. 😇
 

One of my fears in recoveryI remember that onec in high school I stopped caring about how I look and ate when and what I wanted. Of course I gained weight.So now, I’m scared that if I accept myself and not care this much about food I’ll be fat. I want to stay skinny (which I doubt I am but ya know). 





INCOMING: MORE BODY POSI! / OOTD ft a croptop my future MiL brought back from Hawaii! 
I’ve been gaining followers and getting messages since spamming some body/fat posi and I think I wanna talk a little about the body we’re accepting and loving here.
This body is QUEER! My body may have been born “female” but I am NOT a woman, and I am extremely happy with it after fighting years of dysphoria and making the wrong choices for my personal transition. My body refuses and denies all binaries for its personal use. And my body can love any fuckin gender, has a heart big enough for as many loves as will have me at once.
This body is CHRONICALLY ILL! My body suffers from fatigue both physical and mental that never goes away, that DISABLES me from holding a job or going to school (well, it’s a large large factor, so is money) or maintaining some of my hobbies that I used to do. BUT THIS BODY IS NOT BROKEN OR BAD it can still support my every day function with the proper assistance and accommodation! 
This body includes a brain and that brain is MENTALLY ILL! My brain and body are afflicted with SEVERE ANXIETY and other greatly distressing disorders that also DISABLE me from doing many things I want to do, used to do, etc. Sometimes my body is so filled with fear and anger that I get lost in it. BUT my brain and my body my hands can do so much despite and with the struggles it faces - I can create beautiful things, nurture and hold and build and support! 
This body is FAT! And that is not an insult! My body and mind have gone through EATING DISORDERS on and off throughout my late teens/early 20s and we went in FAT and came out FAT and yknow what? That’s okay! Because fat does not mean unhealthy and as long as I am making healthy choices and being aware of my health, I dont need to worry about the number on the scale or if my hands can touch around my thigh.
This body has SCARS and STRETCHMARKS! Natural, accidental, manmade, they are all my history written on my skin. They are a part of me and beautiful or not I will not feel bad for where I’ve come from and who I’m becoming every day and ESPECIALLY not for the growth between those points.
This body is MINE and no matter what I cannot trade it in. It is my responsibility to care for it, nurture it, support it, and fuckin decorate it as I please! And not a single soul besides me has a right to claim any kind of ownership or entitlement to my body.
Long post but I felt like it was important to show the NUANCE and UNIQUENESS of my body when sharing my positivity and acceptance of this damn physical form I was given. I’d fuckin love to see more true acceptance and love not just for how everyone’s body looks, because beauty is a construct and ugly is not a moral failing, but what it does for us and how it connects us to everything around.  

I’m so sick of this heart monitor, can’t wait to get it off tomorrow. Have a body check. Size 12 now 🤷‍♀️ 

Tried out flavor drops for the first time now and I still don’t know if I like them or not. I really love the idea but the taste of some of them is pretty artificial and way too sweet. But I like the vanilla ones. Maybe I just need to try other flavors someday🙈
 

The next thing is not something I feel proud of and might be triggering…Today I discovered that my parents actually believe that I am a threat to myself.That my anxiety, depression and other fucked up behaviours I have, might actually make me suicidal.I discovered that the cuts and bruises I tried to hide a long time ago were never really hidden away from them, they were concious about them.the good thing is…my mum does trust me. 

I need new blogs to follow!Pop me a message or respond to this post if you can recommend any ED / fasting / restricting blogs that are: 5'3" (161cm / 1.6m) or shorter Preferably 18+ Preferably posts any kind of original content (food diaries, body checks, etc) Thanks, loves 🖤 

Day 3: bpd awareness month!
Day three asks about coping skills and mechanisms. 
Let’s be honest. Some days, my coping skills are absolute shit. I no longer self injure (that stayed with me well into my twenties), and it has been about 7 months since my last binge/purge cycle, but I still am guilty of the days when I lay in bed and watch tv for hours. It doesnt matter that I know I will feel better if I get up; I want to lounge in my self-pity and wallow in depression. 
On my good or better days, there are a few things I turn to. Routine is my number one (there is that teacher mentality!). If I follow a routine, my anxiety is lessened which allows me the brain space to work on other issues.  I also often use a yoga nidra sleep meditation at night to try and calm my racing brain.
Some DBT skills are helpful - all types of mindfulness practice, PLEASE, radical acceptance are some of my go-tos.
I also tend to self-sooth with textures (I have a small piece of blanket that I rub between my fingers when I get very anxious, and I have a worry stone and some crystals to hold and use for focus (smoky quartz is my jam).
Sometimes boyf will rub my back when I can’t ground myself.
And my favorite? Snuggling my cat. My little lady is not a snuggler, but my Malcolm is such an attention whore. He loves snuggling and being spooned and that is one of the best coping skills i have. I wish I could bring him to work with me! LOOK AT MY CAT. :-)
 



When mike and I try debating what a healthy calorie range is and we negotiate based on the use of a vitamin 🤦🏻‍♀️ my mind might be sick 🤷🏻‍♀️ 



Yesterday’s challenge: healthy oils🌿
Very very scary but important🙈 

How do you break up with someome you’re not dating? 

“rules” is kinda a harsh word but my dumbass can’t think of anything else lmao-Eat all the fruit u want esp volume fruits.-Stay weary of bananas tho they’re very high calorie and aren’t very filling (no more than two)-Keep away from white bread/pasta/rice as the body doesn’t digest them as well as whole grains, making you store it as fat instead of absorbing nutrients-Drink that mf water!!!! at least 4 bottles a day (got that wet wet)-Wanna snack? Eat some nuts or anything that isn’t a fruit MAX twice a day-No soda hon it’s literally so bad for you ED or not just..no-Still hungry after the snacks? Drink water/tea-NO artificial candies, dark chocolate only. (Even tho it breaks me out but its worth it yknow?)-Always more protein than carbs when eating a prepared meal (Ex: More chicken than rice etc.)-Grilled meats over fried!!!-Oh yeah and I don’t eat red meat or fish but that’s bc I’m transitioning back to being vegan.-Treat yo self!!! Dairy Free Halo Top every now and then yum yum  

I usually don’t ever allow myself to have a full snack all at once. For example if I bought myself such a Twix or any other chocolate bar I could only have a small bite every 5 or 10 minutes. Or if I was on my way to my boyfriend I would have one small piece of the snack every train stop.
Can anyone else relate?😅 



Having some healthy snacks on my way to my boyfriend. These are like fruit rolls I used to do some time ago :)  





*unpaid advertisement*
Got a nice box from Dörrwerk yesterday.
Loved their tomato chips and the apple/mango fruit snack so I wanted to try some different products too.
And I was very happy and suprised to recive a gift from Dörrwerk. One of their products I really thought about buying but I didn’t because I didn’t want to spent too much money again🙈 so this made me very happy :)  



Today’s morning and night snack🍭🍬 





:)  

09.05.19 // FDOE //
Breakfast was a chocolate protein fluff and a white curry omelette :)


For lunch I made a really good soup which filled me up quite a lot (and I challenged myself to have bread with it, even though it’s a fear food and I never add anything else to my lunch because of the cals) 🙈 


Before work I tried these chocolate coated banana chips. And I really loved them *-*


At work I had some snacks and I ate one more portion of my home made veggie soup :)

I really want to share this video with you guys. Please listen to her interview about her anorexia. When I watched her talking about her struggles and thoughts I just feel like it was myself telling someone about how I feel.
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨ 

i want to follow all of you and support and help you through your recovery. we can all get through this together <3 

What my ed related thoughts sayHow active/inactive I have been recentlyMy negative self image 

Every food is a safe food unless it’s poisoned or you are allergic to it. Food won’t hurt you, I promise. 

I’m scared of getting hungry, but I’m more scared of being starved.
I’m scared of finding who I am without my eating disorder, but I’m more scared that I will be defined by it for the rest of my life.
I’m scared of seeing my body change, but I’m more scared of watching it get too small to exist.
I’m scared of recovery but I’m more scared of what happens if I don’t.

What are you more afraid of?
 

this is recovery sometimes. dragged myself out of bed today so that i could get my food in. i had no other reason to get up besides recovery.forgot my meds but took them when i remembered. hours late, but i took them.drank water, but not too much water.forced myself to eat my three meals. and the rest of my food. none of it was very nutritious because i have no energy to make anything, but i ate nonetheless.kept it in, kept it down. kept it all down.pulled my body into the shower. washed my face and moisturized. spent any extra ounce of energy on containment. distracted and processed all day long. i didnt do anything but eat food, process feelings, and contain urges.some days are just going to be like this.this is the reality of what my recovery looked like today. 

an eating disorder will take more than your weight away, it takes your entire happiness and life away. if you’re currently suffering please choose recovery because if you aren’t all you’re doing is slowly killing yourself
you’ll get there. 

Don’t justify your eating disorder by saying that its’ behavior is “normal for everyone.”
Someone recovering from alcoholism cannot allow themselves one drink just because ‘everyone else is having one.’ Similarly, someone recovering from an eating disorder cannot exhibit one behavior (such as over exercising, skipping a meal, or engaging in body shaming) just because others are.
I know that it’s triggering and difficult and seems unfair. But you must let yourself be an exception to the so called “normal."  

Choosing recovery isn’t easy and sticking with it is even harder, but if you do just stick with it you will gain so much more. You can live again, be happy, be healthy, have friends, think clearly, and most of all you will be you again (better and stronger). 

I am so sick of letting the fact I didn’t exercise ruin my mood.I am so sick of letting the fact I “ate too much” allowing me to feel like crap.I am so sick of letting the fact I’ve gained weight make me think I’m worthless.I am so sick of fearing what other people think of my body, my weight gain or my outer appearance in general.  

Not too long ago, I held a round table with some very impressive people who are using their platforms to shatter the stigma around mental illness and substance misuse. Joanna was there, and she spoke so eloquently about the need to share our mental health challenges. She said sharing our stories “spreads awareness like wildfire”. This is her story.When I first began to struggle
with an eating disorder,
 I didn’t know that what I was experiencing had a name. All I knew was 
that food made me extremely anxious and I was terrified of gaining
weight. Because
 I didn’t know that these were hallmarks of an eating disorder, I kept 
my behaviors around food hidden for more than a decade.
I was afraid that no one would believe me if I asked for help. I assumed
 that I would be told to “get over it”—that I was just being dramatic, 
just seeking attention, just going through a phase. Eating
 disorders are not a phase you outgrow; in fact, without treatment, they
 often get worse. My eating disorder began as a way to cope
with problems at home—if I was focused on counting calories and losing 
weight, then I wasn’t focused on the negativity around me. Over time, 
though, these coping behaviors turned into full-blown anorexia
and bulimia with comorbid depression, anxiety, and a substance use disorder. By
 the time I finally sought help at the age of 25, I was exhausted in 
body, mind, and spirit. A therapist told me that she feared I would
die, and I couldn’t even muster the energy to care. Eating
 disorders are not phases, extreme diets, overreactions, or 
attention-seeking ploys. They are mental illnesses with serious, 
life-threatening
consequences. More than 30
million Americans struggle with some form of these disorders, but the vast majority never seeks help. Many
 people suffer in silence because eating disorders are mired in stigma 
and misinformation. One pervasive myth is that only rich, young,
white women develop these disorders. In fact, eating disorders affect people
of every age, gender, race, and socioeconomic status. They are biologically based mental illnesses, and current research suggests they may in part be genetically
determined. 
The good news is that it is possible to fully recover from an eating disorder—and the sooner you act, the better your chances.  
Feb.
 21 through 27 is National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. Across the 
country, individuals and organizations of all kinds are rallying
to bring eating disorders to the fore and urging people to seek help as 
soon as possible. The NEDAwareness website offers a free,
anonymous screening
 that can provide crucial information about whether your eating habits 
or thoughts about weight and body image are healthy or unhealthy.  
I strongly encourage you to take three minutes to do the screening or to pass the link along to friends and family members. You do not have to fight this battle by yourself. There are resources available, and there is hope. 
You are not alone.  
To get screened or to find out more information about eating disorders, visit
the official NEDAwareness website. 

I hate the disconnect between what I consider external recovery (not engaging in ED behaviors) and internal recovery (the underlying body image and food issues) because yes I’m eating but I also still feel fat and gross. 

Truth ♥ 

The recovery picnic is going ahead this Saturday in London!!
Bring a picnic lunch and come along to meet lots of lovely people and have a nice afternoon in the sun (weather forecast is INSANE; bring suncream!)
Message me (therewillbeadawn) for the time and meeting place :)
Even if you can’t make it, please reblog to share with your followers! 

ok but shit like this seriously freaks me out so much 

Like this if you are in recovery from an eating disorder/self harm and I will check out your blog. 
I need to follow some blogs that have weight restored and are moving forward in recovery as motivation that I can keep moving forward as well. 
Also, if anyone is in recovery from an eating disorder, and since recovering have gotten a job/got into university, I would really appreciate if you could comment on this if I can ask you about that transition? 

tomorrow is christmas and I just wanted to say that you are entitled to the happiness that comes with the holidays. You are allowed to eat and not feel guilty. You are allowed to live and feel happy. You are allowed to nourish your body. You are allowed to be alive and enjoy it. 

That’s all.
Go me.

                There is no beauty in death            


I met with the nutritionist today and she conference called my therapist.  They both want me to do residential and wanted me to call and do the intake today
My insurance would have a $150 copay per admission and then everything would be covered 100%.  I think that’s good.  They don’t specify a length of time.  Is that normal?
I have to do the intake tomorrow.
I am still adamant that I won’t go if it means that I won’t have my job to go back to and that I need to be able to finish my remaining applications to grad school.  The nutritionist said I should have blinders on and only focus on this but I don’t feel like destroying all of the things I’ve worked hard for and that give meaning to my life would be a recipe for lasting recovery when I get back.
I’ll do the intake tomorrow morning
Then I will have an estimate of timeline, so I can try to call employee services again.  I might have to call my boss too.  Which is awkward.
I won’t have access to social media at all while I’m there and I’ll likely have to get a burner phone (something without a camera).  So that means that either I won’t be able to talk to people at all or that I’ll have to let people know what’s happening.  Obviously, I could tell a few people and that would be fine but I really hate dropping off the face of the planet for weeks/months at a time.
I won’t be able to go on tumblr.  Will need hella queued posts.
My impulse to prepare is to go shopping
I’m on my way to meet up with a friend who did this program a few years ago to ask her about it and also because I feel like I’m going to explode/die of anxiety
I don’t feel like any of this is real and that if I ate like, a huge cookie or something, everyone would admit they’d been just trying to scare me into eating and let me not go
I feel like there are so many uncertainties
Therapist and nutritionist insist that we need to do this now because they don’t want a medical hospitalization to be used if at all avoidable.  This feels silly to me.
I feel like my head is full of pressure and thoughts and feelings
I’m going to have my therapist call and tell my parents tomorrow once things are more figured out because I’m the world’s biggest baby
The program is for 16-26 year old female identified people, and I’m near the older end.  I feel weird about that.
Also, there’s a height limit at this treatment center and that seems fuckin weird!  Like, they wouldn’t admit my younger sister if she needed it because she’s over a certain height and it’s not even that tall.  Idk.  Weird.  Is there a special hospital for tall girls?
 

One year ago today, I was discharged from a residential inpatient treatment facility
- one year without being admitted inpatient
- one year without suicidal ideation
- one year self harm free
I honestly didn’t ever expect to go this long without being put back into a crisis center, and let me tell you…. every day that goes by (generally speaking), things get better. I’m still fighting some demons, but every day that goes by, things get easier. 
Recovery is hard and scary but it’s POSSIBLE and its WORTH IT!! I promise!! I’m living proof!!!! 

Whoops, I totally didn’t record a spoken word version of my favourite poem about recovery that you can watch here and laugh at my silly Mancunian accent and awkward camera face :) It’s not my poem, it belongs to a lady called Sarah T, and I believe that @comemorningslight was the person who introduced this beauty to me <3 So yes @metamorphosisofmeg @stellar-rose @elsawrotethat @pepsimaxed and anyone who needs a little spark of inspiration, all my love! x 

Guys! Today I’ve been purge-free for a year!!! 

questions :)  

I don’t know, seeing all of the ‘it’s hard but i’m trying" and the “I CONQUERED THIS!” makes me so hopeful. Even though there’s so much struggle in recovery, it’s so worth it for those little moments of bravery and happiness, which slowly increase in frequency. And every day, so many people are finding themselves again. 
It’s just kind of nice. c: 

• People recovering from an eating disorder who become vegan. Having a plant-based diet is great, it’s healthy if you do it right, it’s good for the environment and the animals. But we all know you don’t really gain weight on a plant-based diet. The only reason people with EDs go vegan is because they can stay skinny. I guarantee you, if veganism made you gain weight the number of vegans in recovery would decrease massively. 
• People recovering from an eating disorder and becoming lifters! Gaining your weight back in muscle is not recovery!!!!! You are still just trying to control the way your body looks. 
It seems like so many people in the recovery community do one or both of these things. All of this #strongnotskinny bullshit is not recovery. There are people in *actual* recovery wondering why they don’t look as skinny as the other girls on Instagram, thinking they’re gaining too much weight. Real recovery is freeing yourself from being obsessed with food and your body and allowing yourself to look how you are supposed to look. Don’t follow the trends - recover for real. You don’t want to be sick forever. 

some days I don’t even think about my eating disorder anymore and some days I do. at times my head is so caught in the moment I’m overcome with joy, but at other times it’s so caught in the past I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to dig myself out. I go for weeks without weighing myself, not caring about having fried food twice in a day and shaking off  body negative comments; then, at the strangest moments life comes crashing down and I’m paralyzed with numbers and behaviors in one big crashing wave. and that’s recovery for you. 
each interruption, each meltdown will eventually grow farther and farther apart ‘til it becomes something you deal with once a month, once a year, once a decade. 
recovery is slow, tedious and boring but it is worth it, it just takes time. 

A week ago I would have said “Well, of course I did!” but where I’ve been lately it makes me feel quite guilty.
But here’s the thing
I have a short essay due in under 3 hours that I could only finish half of last night because I was sounable to focus on anything.
I refuse to put my eating disorder before school. So no matter how hard it is or guilty it makes me feel, school comes before my ED. I never want to go back to a time when they were equally important to me (if not my ED more important). 
I have permission to eat.
I didn’t go to my internship this morning because I slept so poorly last night. (Okay this was actually mostly bunny-related haha. Cheerio feels the need to become hyperactive in his cage at around 4am most nights).
I can hear the nursery school kids playing outside my window and this reminds me of two things (a) How during my ED I lost that job because I just stopped showing up even though I loved it. I was so consumed by restricting, binging, and purging that the idea of walking a quarter mile and being responsible for young children was unfathomable. (b) What I want for my life is to work with children, not to be anorexic or eating disordered. 
 The more I think about, the prouder I feel.

…being able to go to the grocery store and not feel my soul being sucked into the cakes, cookies, and ice cream as I have a mental and emotional war over the decision to binge or not.
I went to the grocery today and found myself by the cake fridge thing. I looked at it and remembered how those trips used to go. I would shake with anticipation and at the same time, feel overwhelming guilt and anxiety. I would constantly be calculating prices on my phone to figure out the biggest binge for my buck. I hated it, and I loved it. Today I looked at the cakes, and then continued with my shopping. I could look at them and think “that one is pretty, I like how they decorated it.” Not “fuck, $14? Do I have $14? Yeah but that’s the only thing I would be able to eat and I don’t know if it’s big enough. What about the cookies? I could do cookies and ice cream, but the cake would probably be easier to throw up. Maybe I’ll do cereal tonight. BUT I WANT THE CAKE. Fuck it, I’ll steal food from the dollar store if it isn’t enough food. What is wrong with me?”
All hail recovery. 

Therapist: based on what you’ve told me you have OSFEDTumblr: THIS IS INVALIDATING. 
I found it hard to digest. An ED is an ED. Actually, I fought to get a diagnosis at all because I was clinically obese when I became unwell and lost weight to a ‘healthy’ BMI. Yet my body was starved and malnourished and my vitals were off.. my mental anguish over my body and relationship with food was crushing
But you know what? I’m so glad I got sick at that weight. I would be dead if I had been at a lower weight. EDNOS, BPD, BDD, OCD… they don’t define me. They just affect my treatment. 
I am Grace. Not a diagnosis.  

Are you struggling to drink that Ensure today? Try pouring it into a wine glass.Are you cutting out ingredients from your salad? Have a loving friend make it for you.Get out the good crystal, and drink that smoothie out of a goblet! 

“Recovery does not mean cure. Rather recovery is an attitude, a stance, and a way of approaching the days challenges. It is not a perfectly linear journey. There are times of rapid gains and disappointing relapses. There are times of just living, just staying quiet, resting and regrouping. Each person’s journey of recovery is unique. Each person must find what works for them. This means that we must have the opportunity to try and to fail and to try again.” (Patricia Deegan, Ph.D.) 

Last year I couldn’t even wear a tee shirt without a jacket.Now I’m looking at two piece bathing suits for the first time in my life.Things get better with recovery, I promise. 


                — 
                giving to everybody but myself is just so much easier–but that’s not really living is it?            


eating is good because it makes all of your loved ones happy
and it preserves your fertility so you can make babies
and it keeps you from having a heart attack
and it stops your bones from deteriorating and crumbling 
and your hair from falling out…
and 
energy
whatever. 

I freaking got this. If anyone, including me, tries to convince me otherwise, just save your spit. I wont give in. Instead, I’ll work harder, madafaka. 

Me: “I had an eating disorder in college, but I’m two years in recovery now.”
Doctor: “Anorexia? Bulimia?”
Me: “A fun combination of both.” 

I was diagnosed with Bulimia years ago but I fit EDNOS more now. Anyway, I am looking to recover but I am overweight. So my question is how do you recover from an ed if you don’t need to gain weight? 
If ANYONE has any advice/experience/thoughts I would really appreciate it. 

NO MEGAN
DON’T FUCKING RELAPSE NOW
YOU’RE DOING WELL
IT ISN’T WORTH IT
ugh I’ve been really insecure about my weight again recently and it is taking all of my energy to stop myself from slipping.
But I’m not going to.
I’ve nearly got to my discharge date. I have nothing to prove to anyone. It’s better to be happy. I deserve to be happy. I deserve to be happy. 

My ED is so bad. I haven’t purged in 6 days, which I know is a huge win, but it’s only because I’ve been restricting heaps. I’ve been under 1000 cals for 7 days in a row and net negative cals for at least 4 of them. I also took laxatives for the first time in months last night. I’m ashamed. But I’m stuck and I don’t know how to get back up from this. Nan is worried and upset and I’m angry and confused. Why did one little overdose set off this whole chain reaction? Why, when I go into the hospital for more than a severe anxiety attack, do I come out and restrict like crazy? Its not okay. And it does not help that I had bad 24 hour gastro on Friday. That’s what triggered the laxative abuse. 
Again, I know that I have to be the one to save myself. I’ve got to find my motivation to eat, just like I did last time. Except last time I was very close to being hospitalised, and that scared me. So I ate. Then lost weight. Then was told to gain. Then began blind weigh ins. Now, I’m medically fine, my weight is relatively stable and I’m no where near hospital. Does this mean I will keep going until I am? Until I am told once again to gain weight? Until my obs are once again shocking? I have to save myself. No one else can fix this but me. I have all the support I could ever need or ask for, yet here I am relapsing. I have to be my own strength. 
I will recover.  

For the first time since my ED started four years ago I have gone a whole week without binging, purging, or restricting. 
I’m pretty damn proud of myself😁👏🏻🎉 

I’m actually awake at a normal time, so I’m actually going to be a functional member of society today… Yay! And I’m having a super yummy breakfast! 

hi! friendly reminder for today:
drink some water friend, it’s good for u + remember that you are so loved and valued + hey, you, YES YOU you’re a  force of nature and unstoppabble and you can achieve anything today + getting out of bed counts as an achievement + take care of yourself!! +put yourself first, buddy +have a good day because you really do deserve all the happiness!
love you, sunshine! 
today is first day going out to the beach (waterpark) since i’ve been in recovery and i’m feeling quite body confident :) lets do this! 

Breakfast: bran flakes and banana in milk Snack: sweet and salty popcorn and a chocamento hot chocolate Lunch: peanut butter sandwich, mango, melon and pineapple Snack: an apple, cappuccino thins and amaretto cookies with milky tea Dinner: tomato soup and a plain bagel Snack: a box of daim mikado 

gave my ED Awareness/NEDA speech last week and just got my grade back. I got a 77. my professor was not amused that I went over the time limit. he pulled me aside after class and
professor: are you aware of how long you went over? almost four minutes! there’s a subtraction of one point for every ten seconds you go over. that’s 22 points right there.
me: well you know what. when i was deciding whether I wanted to keep talking or lose a few points, i chose to keep talking because if this speech positively affects the life of ONE person with an eating disorder, or changes the attitude of ONE person who before thought eating disorders were a “choice” or were about vanity, it’s worth it.
professor: well maybe if you had heard me the day i mentioned the rule about the point deduction, you would have done it differently and stopped on time. 
me:   -_- did you hear what i said.
oh well. my speech was still heard by 21 people. afterwards, a guy asked about images in the media in relationship to EDs, and i explained to him that they don’t cause eating disorders, but they certainly negatively affect people who have them and are not helpful. eliminating myths and stigmas classroom by classroom. overall, definitely worth it! 

Like I wake up feeling/looking normal and as the day goes on my stomach starts to poke out and by the time it’s late evening I feel like I’m 7 months pregnant. 
It’s really triggering.
Please tell me this is a normal part of recovery…? 

If I could have one wish for my entire life, it would be for a world not obsessed with food, calories, weight, exercise, and appearance. 

I feel a bit better again
I realised I was slipping back to my ed and I know now that’s not what I want
I want to be happy and be myself again,not consumed by my ed and totally unhappy
So I will fight, starting with eat some chocolate, just because I’m able to 

I have to avoid enough diet/weightloss thoughts coming from my own mind, being surrounded by “dieting, lose ten pounds this week!, eat less, lose weight” from media, friends, family etc. is too much.

Okay guys, I need some advice. TW for calories/BMI
So, I’ve been existing in this state of quasi recovery for a very long time, months, maintaining/okay losing weight on 1100 cals and exercise. My metabolism is so fucked that theoretically I could keep doing this for a long time without dipping dipping into danger land. My BMI is 19.6; which isn’t actually underweight, but my body isn’t healthy, and my mind isn’t healthy. I’m tired, dizzy, cold and unhappy.
I’m tired of this. This isn’t recovery. It’s exhausting and I’m not getting anywhere. I keep telling myself I’ll increase tomorrow. Tomorrow comes and I say the same thing. And then say the same thing the next day. 
But hell, I don’t want 2015 to be like this; like 2014. In 2015, I want to get free of this horrible illness that has haunted me since I was twelve. I want to take the plunge and increase to 1800 calories a day. 
Problem is, I’m terrified. I’m terrified of gaining more weight. I’m terrified of eating ‘normal’ amounts. But I’m also terrified that I’ll never get free of this. I’m terrified that I’ll be sick forever. 
I don’t know how to do this, so I’m asking for help. How do I fit 1800 calories into a day? How do I start increasing? Do I do it slowly or just take the leap? Will I gain weight? How do I live with myself if I do? 
Please, I’m asking for any advice or help or meal plan ideas or literally anything you might have to offer. 

I feel bummed when a lot of people reblog a post about a negative thing about myself because it makes me sad that a lot of people feel that way about themselves too. 

Just a little reminder that you’re all beautiful inside and out! Whatever troubles you are going through will pass. Just hold tight lovelies. 

I downloaded a log chart to input my food/calories to make sure I’m getting enough, and to try and figure out where I can add more food during my day.  I have slots for 3 meals and 3 snacks.  I’ve accepted that it’s already 6PM and I won’t be hitting over 1,000 calories today no matter how hard I try.  But I’m gonna aim for 2,000 tomorrow for the first time in months, so.
Wish me luck. 

If you had told me this time last year that I would be cooking with oil I would have cried. This year I have used *unmeasured* oil on multiple occasions.
If you had told me this time last year that I would be able to eat and tolerate unknown calorie/unsafe pasta and rice I would have adamantly shook my head in disbelief. This year I have eaten homemade spaghetti bolognese cooked by my wonderful aunt who doesn’t buy my safe pasta.
If you had told me last year that I would go more than one month binge and purge free I would have laughed in your face. I can’t remember my last binge and purge.
If you had told me that I would eventually weigh 9st again I would have told you screamed that you were wrong. This year I have reached 9st again and I’m still happier than I was at my lowest weight.
If you had told me that I would be able to go to parties and eat and drink alcohol I would have called you a liar. I have been to two parties in the last week!
If you had told me that I would find someone to love who loved me back unconditionally I would have rolled my eyes. I have the most amazing boyfriend but even if I didn’t I’ve still found someone who loves me: me.
If you had told me this time last year that I could be someone, and do something, I would have told you where to go. This year I have dreams, I have goals, and I am more determined than ever to reach them.
If you had told me that I would survive the year I wouldn’t have believed you. This year I did more than survive - I have lived. 

i have an exciting time coming up yay. tomorrow is pizza night with some amazing girls from school and i am either going to wear my jazzy new jumpsuit or my flowery dress so either way i will feel happy regardless and i am going to eat a ‘spanish’ (manchego cheese, pepper and rosemary potato) pizza and laugh lots. wednesday is choir - last rehearsal pre concert which is 3 days before austria HELLZ YA. thursday is open night which is always such a fun night because i am a sheer patriot to my school and i love showing people round and being like APPLY TO COME HERE IT IS MY LIFE IT IS AMAZING haha yeah. friday is a cake/theatre date with my drama girlies who i miss very much because we used to see each other every single day back when we were aspiring and prospering actresses and now we hardly ever see each other so it’ll be cuuuuuute.  

Eating around people (especially if they aren’t eating)  should not scare me that much 

eating “normally” is still a challenge because like…
we had spaghetti for dinner and it was so delicious and then this pumpkin pudding for dessert which i love…
so i ended up eating so much that i was super super full.
i hurried downstairs and attempted to purge but as usual (and because of my stomach surgery) i just strained all of my internal organs and was snotting everywhere and my eyes were watering so much and I nearly peed myself but nothing came up. 
So I was like eff this.
And I walked out of the bathroom and Penny was just staring at me looking all concerned and making me feel ashamed of myself. 
SO I’m still super full and freaking out but it’s okay. I just wish I didn’t feel so full up.  

It may sound crazy, but I’m kind of thankful for my eating disorder because recovery gave me a much more functional relationship with food and my body.
One bowl of cereal at 10 pm because I’m hungry, not an entire box plus three donuts because I’m emotionally distraught? Yes please. 

It terrifies me when I see adults on here with eating disorders. And by adult I mean like 20-25. I don’t want that. I don’t want to be an adult and have to deal with adult stuff and an eating disorder. I’ve already lost almost all of my teenage years to self-harm, depression and my eating disorder, I refuse to let those things take my adulthood too. So that’s why I’m doing this! I am recovering so I can enjoy my last year as a teenager (Provided I’ve mostly overcome a lot of this in the next 6 months)! I’m done giving the best years of my life to these demons in my head, when they should belong to me to do all the fun things that I want to do! 

OKAY GUYS
I’m going to challenge myself to a fear food on friday so I need you to help me decide what to have
1) A gingerbread man
2) A packet of crisps (the proper crisps, not pombears or quavers, I’m talking about Kettle crisps)
3) Pic and Mix
So what would you guys like to see me try? 

a blog full of recovery art. submitted by real people, anything from an art therapy exercise done in treatment to a favorite recovery quote expressed through collage. submitters could include a few words about their pieces and how they relate to their recovery.
iunno i just think it would be cool.

I had a large cookie today AND a v. rich brownie (on top of 3 meals)
But they were both homemade with love and care and given by a good friend who took a long time over them and they were SO delicous
Plus I resisted the urge to binge after eating them!!!!! Ahhhh :D Getting control of my eating
And realising it’s ok to occasionally eat a brownie and a cookie.
I don’t even feel guilty
Fuck you BED fuck fuck fuck you
<3 

Please tell me it’s okay to have pizza. 

Even though I gained 10-12 pounds since I started ednos recovery, I was never happy with the way I looked. Today, while trying on clothing, even though my scars are purple from the cold, I actually took a second to look at myself. My tattoo adorns my side perfectly, it looks beautiful there, so right. I actually look nice. I have a cute butt, and I have nice thighs, my boobs aren’t small, but they’re nice. My collarbones show a healthy amount. All in all… I look nice. I never thought I’d ever say that. Today marks a victory for me against the mirror today. 

I hope you know how wonderful you are and continue with the strength to be the best person you can be! 

As exciting as losing weight is I am so envious of people who have the ability just maintain their normal weight without yo yo-ing (ie most normal people!) And those who don’t have such a twisted relationship with food.
That’s why probably the most crucial part of this journey to getting healthier is learning to have a sensible and sane relationship with food and exercise. So I can maintain it when I finally get there :D
Every decision I make at the moment I try and think ‘Could I sustain this? For a week, for a month, for the rest of my life?’
So no excessive exercising,  no restriction, tackling my bingeing.
That’s the goal :) 

Today was the memorial service for my 17 year old cousin who died of heart failure. Due to complications she was born with, not ones she created chasing perfection and thinness. She was a girl who appreciated life even though she had it so much harder than I do, when I look at life and sometimes wonder why I bother, even with all of my blessings and privileges.
And I noticed that no one mentioned her weight during the reflections. No one at my cousin’s memorial praised the amount of calories she ate. What they remembered about her was how much she touched their lives, how she loved without reserve, how she inspired them. They talked about who she was, not what she ate or didn’t eat. And yes, they talked about how beautiful she was, but they didn’t talk about her body. 
What they talked about was her smile. And that really hit me. If it were my memorial, how many people there would remember what my genuine smile looked like? I don’t want to leave this earth with anyone at my memorial wondering what my smile looked like. How tragic would that be?
So I have to beat this thing. If for that one reason. I don’t want to be remembered in profile, looking elegant and thin but with tortured eyes. I don’t want aunts and uncles to only remember speaking with me once when I asked about the calories in a dish they cooked. I want to be remembered smiling, really smiling. Engaging in conversation rather than withdrawing into a corner. I want them to remember me, not ED possessing my body. 

I know some guy walked across the Grand Canyon today but I ate a muffin for breakfast today and I’d say I feel just as accomplished as him. 

If I created a recovery support group on Facebook would you guys join it?
I am in another support group on FB for PCOS and I’ve found the support of others has been very beneficial to me. It’s just a place where everyone can post their thoughts/feelings/positivity/goals/rewards/etc. I want it to be a positive environment where everyone can ban together and kick their addiction/disorder’s ass! I will try to post positive quotes, lyrics, pictures, etc. in the group for motivation and encouragement each day.
But before I go through the trouble of creating the group, is this something you guys would be interested in? 

Woo I have been ‘in recovery’ since october, so 7 months now! I had relapsed for 2/7 months I really am trying now. I was really struggling this week, but I am not even close to how I used to be. No more overexercising, no more x-hour fasts, no more skipping meals and throwing dinner away. I never expected to make so much progress in so little time. 

For real though I’m actually going to exercise and eat healthy and stop purging and restricting.
ED recovery blogs please follow me and I’ll follow back, I need support and food suggestions 

thank you! I can’t even begin to tell you how liberating it feels. I used to get into so many arguments with my parents because I refused to eat rice. Considering how it was a staple in my family, you could only imagine how poorly they took it. I even tried to convince myself (and them) that i didn’t like the taste of rice. Hahahhah. That was ridiculous. I think I’ve come a long way since those ED days :) 

I always told myself that if I could just make it to 135 pounds, I’d be happy. I’d stop hating myself and would feel beautiful, I thought.
I stayed up at night fantasizing about how great I’d look in a swimsuit. How I’d smile at myself in the mirror rather than painfully avoiding my reflection. How I’d BE somebody. 
Well, I finally made it to 135 pounds. And I feel exactly the same.
Fuck you, bulimia. Fuck you for planting yourself so deep inside me that even when I think I’ve rid myself of you, you’re still here. You’ll always be here to tell me I need to lose another 20, suck in a little more, keep my head down so people don’t have to look at the fat girl.
Fuck you, bulimia.

I just want to be skinny 

To my British peeps with eating disorders: please for the love of god look after yourselves during this heatwave. 

I’ll have been in active recovery for nine months.That’s as long as it takes to grow a baby.In my mind right now, I’m envisioning a little recovery baby, all wrapped up in blankets, who’s finally out of the protection of the womb and ready to face the real world, but who desperately needs me to take care of her.Don’t worry, little recovery babe. I’ll protect you and feed you and love you. I may not do it perfectly, but I will do my best. (Holy shit, you guys. Has it really, REALLY been that long?) 

recovery is shitty, but relapse is even shittier, so i think we all know what the obvious choice here is 

I’m sleepy. But my body hurts. Like a lot. 
I had an appointment with my dietician…yesterday I guess? :P We agreed that I’m really not doing well at all on the eating front and that something really needs to change. 
I feel like while I’m not consciously trying to restrict, it’s happening and then when I look back I’m like “well it’s not that bad…” Even though it IS bad. It’s not good to be skipping as many meals as I had been. 
Also we agreed that I should probably get some kind of contact in place to talk to someone soon. I’ve just gone through so so much in the past 7-8 months. Things just keep happening too. I’m so burnt out and I’m actually really glad I’m not going back to work until next week, because I need to just not think for now. 
I want to start going to the gym again, but I dunno. Like I want to, but I’m so tired all the time. I want to because I want to be healthy, but I also want to because I’ve gained so much weight in the last year and I look like a fucking beached whale. 
I dunno. There’s just a lot right now. 

I am making some progress. 
My new doctor is amazing and I love her and she is so great. I’ve got some health issues she is concerned about but thinks will be corrected once I am fully on track recovery wise. So we are keeping an eye on it. But I’m getting labs done and having check ups monthly, which is hella expensive but if it means I’m being held accountable and my problems are getting fixed then it is worth it. 
Dating continues to be an experience. I’ve fallen back into some bad body image thinking. But I see my therapist this week and I think it will help. 
Anyway. Overall life is good and I am really on it and everything is falling into place. 

As a child you would waitAnd watch from far away.But you always knew that you’d be the one that works while they all playAnd you, you’d lay awake at night and schemeOf all the things that you would change…. but it was just a dream!Here we are, don’t turn away now—We are the warriors that built this town.Here we are, don’t turn away now—We are the warriors that built this town.From Dust…..My ED SOLDIERS. I LOVE YOU. I AM FIGHTING THIS BATTLE WITH YOU, AT YOUR SIDE. 

So, yesterday I took a step back in recovery… the doctors put a feeding tube back in because I wasn’t finishing meals. I HATE this tube and I want to rip it out, if you are in recovery please just eat you do not want this tube!

I’m 23 and a medical professional. I live in the US, Oregon to be specific.
I’ve been diagnosed on multiple parts of the eating disorder spectrum. I struggle with bulimia and was diagnosed in 2013. My eating disorder has morphed throughout the years, and I was also diagnosed ednos (2011) and anorexia binge purge subtype (2006).
I am also diagnosed bipolar II, c-ptsd, and I have a substance abuse issue. When I was younger, I struggled with self injury. I haven’t engaged in those behaviors for about a year :]
I’ve participated and graduated from a partial hospitalization program four times, inpatient hospital stay for medical stabilization twice, and extensive outpatient DBT treatment for two years.
I don’t post fitspo, or numbers; my blog is a safe space in my opinion.
I’m always here if anyone wants to talk, would like advice, or just to be a friendly person in your corner or the world.

It’s ok to feel. It’s ok to feel good and it’s also ok to feel bad. Emotions are normal. You need not be ashamed of how you are feeling. 
But in recovery it’s essential for you to admit how you are feeling and work through it. It’s ok to feel a bad feeling, but it’s not ok to act upon the negative urges those feelings bring. 
You need to be able to Admit how you feel to be able to move forwards and to allow others to support you in doing this when you don’t feel strong enough to do it alone.
There should be no shame in struggling 

Okay I know I’m pescetarian for God knows what reasons but I just ate a meal that includes meat for the first time in 3 years! And it wasn’t that bad!! Woohoo! I consider this a badass recovery win! Take that ED!!!

i wanna exercise the right amount and eat the right amount and sleep the right amount and breathe 

just ate a pizza fuck Ani 

1. when drinking alcohol 
2. when i wake up in the middle of the night (insomniac)
3. within the first 30 minutes after eating anything, but mostly after breakfast and dinner
4. after eating something from a vending machine/gas station 
5. when eating alone
6. when grocery shopping alone
7. when im bored and lonely
8. when i feel even remotely over full
9. when i dont take my add/adhd medication
so, essentially… no more drinking or limiting it to once a week or every other week with friends who like IHOP lol, trying to find something to help with my insomnia, finding something to occupy my mind after eating like cleaning/washing dishes/taking a walk/painting my nails/showering, only eating sit down meals (preferably cooked), not eating alone (my dads gonna be so weirded out when i eat in front of him lol), and making actual grocery lists and making someone go with me (my boyfriend, because he hates shopping and hell make the process quick), stopping when im satiated and not going crazy with worry if i feel a little too stuffed, taking my medication at better times, and finding another hobby and staying around people even though i dont really like chit chatting that much. 
binge/fear foods:
1. poptarts
2. breakfast cereals (lucky charms, etc)
3. peanut butter, pb2
4. bread
5. protein bars
6. 100 cal packs 
7. vending machine food
8. cookies, muffins, cakes…
i will say that i usually wont eat a random cupcake/muffin/cake, like they have to be from an actual bakery… its the other stuff that usually gets to me. it usually starts with cereal, then protein bars, or poptarts… 
like i remember going with my mom to work as a kid (she was a single mom managing a local bilo grocery store so shed wake me up at 0400 to be at work at 0500 before taking me to kindergarten…and going to the staff lounge where shed give me a bag of sweet sixteen donuts for breakfast and a little carton of milk and i ate if i was hungry and didnt if i was too sleepy or was mad if she woke me up too early lol (im cranky when i dont wake myself up). i would eat like 2 or 3 and stop because my little tummy was full. Now, since these foods are deemed as “bad” and i hate my body…i get the urge to binge/purge when im upset or too tired and forget only having 2 or 3…if i ate one, id probably end up eating the whole damn bag.
i wish i hadnt been exposed to the horrid cycle of dieting. i wish my grandmother hadnt called me fat or compared me to my then skinny cousin or her prom queen pictures from the 50s, that i hadnt watched that gymnast movie and purged that bowl of lucky charms for the first time when i was 11, that i hadnt restricted so bad and passed out when i was 14 and binged on pizza and wendys chicken nuggets afterwards…
i wish i hadnt taken my insecurities out on my younger brothers, who now use food to comfort themselves. one is especially overweight and abt to start high school, and i am terrified for him because he is so sensitive. i feel horrible and blame myself because i called him fat.
ed ruins you. 

Fuck, I forgot to take my pill today and I’m feeling kinda sad, I feel I’ve eaten too much and I’m disgusted with myself. Please somebody help? :( 

The feeling of being triggered for a moment actually made me realize I WANT TO GET BETTER. I don’t want to be fragile. I don’t want to have to cover my ears at the talk of nutrition. I want to be strong- mentally and physically. Continuing recovery is the only way that’s going to happen.  

I would love to connect with other girls around my age (16) who are currently in recovery! Message me if you need support or just want to chat! :)
PS: Icebreakers!! I’m from Canada, almost done grade 11, play soccer, love all kinds of music, my passion is traveling, I’m working my way back up to a healthy weight, and I’m proud to say I love food again. Don’t be shy!  

Days purge free: one
I tried to eat normal yesterday, my stomach rejected the food. Today I got rid of my fitness pal. I can’t obsess about food all the time. Or the amount that I’m going to restrict or over exercise so I can lose x lbs. but I don’t even know if I have because I have not weighed myself in forever. Next Friday I will. My parents are coming back tonight :) I got food so I could make them a nice breakfast ( that I will also be eating) probably not till noon or something because they get back late. I have also realized that when my blood sugar drops from not enough food, that it’s not that my eyes are dry, it’s that I am legit about to cry. I will try to eat. One day at a time…. 

I’m experiencing extreme hunger for the first time today, so I finally know what all the fuss is about. Dear fucking God. My stomach feels like an empty bag - con·stant·ly. I had dinner less than an hour ago and I’m already so hungry I could eat a horse (take into account that I’m a pescetarian). 

Had some chocolate before hopping into bed.
Physically my stomach feels identical to that ‘fat’ feeling but my mind isnt being so harsh about it. I feel full. So rounded and big and full of delicious chocolatey goodness. I can’t say that there’s no guilt, but it’s such a small amount of guilt that eating the chocolate actually feels worth it and I’m glad I ate it.  
Good morning. It’s a new day. Breathe. A fresh start. Take a deep breath. Forgive yourself for mistakes you made yesterday. Make yourself proud today. Smile. You can choose who you want to be today. Get a glass of water. You are divine. Do not treat yourself as anything less.

I do this ALL the time. It’s a really hard habit to break. There are so many things we think that we should be doing and ideas about where we should be in life. Changing “should” to “could” reduces the shame and promotes autonomy. Just because you CAN do something doesn’t mean you HAVE to, and that’s the difference.  
Signs of a relapseSince I struggle really hard  with my ED at the moment, I thought that I could at least use it to write down some warning signs of a relapse incoming. At least those were my signs:*Mirror checking more frequently*Constantly thoughts about what and how much I’ve eaten*Suddenly being hyper aware of my thighs touching, my belly feeling full*General ‘fat’ feeling*Return of the fear foods (sounds like a movie title :D)*Forgetting / ignoring the horrors the ED brought you*Feeling more vulnerable*Hating your looks*'Soft’ restricting (like, eating juuuuust a little less than you need)*Feeling dirty / wanting to feel 'clean’ againHow about you guys? What are your warning signs? Anyway, I’m still trying not to give in.F*ck off, anorexia!!!

Mental illness: You have to suffer.Mental illness: But you can’t burden anyone else with your suffering, or you’re a terrible personMental illness:But you gotta suffer real hard, so hard it makes it difficult to function and hard to not physically show.Mental illness: But you can’t let anyone know you’re suffering otherwise you’re manipulative and a liarMental illness: But you can’t smile and act happy otherwise you’re invalid and not truly suffering correctly.Mental illness: Suffer. 
Can I just say: if you’re “curious” about something diet/food/body/weight related and you have a history of eating disorders (or disordered eating or body dysmorphia or OCD), DO NOT do the thing. Don’t add up how many calories you ate today just because you’re “curious.” Don’t measure yourself, don’t look up some celebrity’s measurements, don’t look into macros or keto or BMI charts or ANYTHING else like that. That stuff is absolutely TOXIC and even giving in one time can turn into a habit. So please, if you care about yourself and you want to recover or just don’t want to get worse, IGNORE THE URGE!! 
Shoutout to everyone who struggled with their body image today. Who maybe couldn’t stand to look in the mirror, who thought toxic thoughts about themselves, who felt like there was no way they could learn to love themselves. Learning to love your body is hard. It takes time. It’s okay if today was an off day, or if it’s been an off week or month or year. Just keep trying. You’ll get there, I promise.  
There is no shame in trying again. Recovery is not a straight path, sometimes you slip up. There is no shame in making mistakes, as long as you continue to put yourself back on the road to recovery! 

you are stronger and braver than you think&you are worth more than you can imagine. 

When you weigh yourself in the morning and you haven’t magically lost 50 pounds overnight 

You know what’s weird:Everyone warns you about the dizzinessEveryone warns you about the hunger painsEveryone warns you about feeling sick all the timeEveryone warns you about getting the shakesEveryone warns you about hair falling outEveryone warns you about your nails going yellowAnd I was okay with all of this because I could hide itBut what no one tells you about is the exhaustionNo one warns you about sleeping for half the dayNo one warns you about taking an hour to get out of bed every morning No one warns you that doing the simplest tasks take all the energy you have No one warns you that you will always feel tired no matter how much coffee you drink or how many vitamin supplements you take And I wasn’t ready for not being able to live my life anymore

You can’t change your bone structure. Not everyone can have a thigh gap. Didn’t have one when I was 130 lbs, still wasn’t there at 90lbs. I always have had small arms but a big waist/stomach. At my lowest weight, I still had the same stomach, but I could perfectly see my ribs. Didn’t really lose lots of inches there. So please, don’t beat yourself up if your thighs are still touching. If your fingers can’t touch when surrounding your waist. Bone structure is not something you can control.  You are doing enough.

Hiding your ED from your Parents/Loved OnesOf course recovery is the best option, but this is for the people that face hardships with their mental health due to excessive questioning from family/friends.1. NEVER let anyone know you think you’re fat. Don’t say it, don’t imply it. When you start losing they’ll immediately assume you’re anorexic and pay more attention to your weight.2. Chew gum when you haven’t eaten all day and you are to come in contact with your family. Apparently your breath picks up a smell when you don’t eat that gives you away, even if you brush your teeth.3. Your lip color also gives you away. Use chapstick before adding a layer of lipstick on top. Your lips turn white if they’re hungry and coloring them makes people less suspicious.4. (You will have to waste food for this one, warning for anyone who feels guilty about that)When say you ate but you didn’t, take a plate and fill it with food to an amount that’s “acceptable.” Take a ziplock bag (or foil) and put the food in there. Leave the dirty dishes and hide the bag/foil in the trash can under other trash. Not filling it with food will give you away, people will grow suspicious if you always say you eat but the amount of food never shrinks. If it’s not safe there, wait to throw it in the garbage can outside, or hide it in your room until it’s safe. If it’s indoors make sure to use candles or perfume to cover up the smell.5. When you buy clothes, buy them just a little smaller than what fits you. This can be motivating, and when you eventually fit into them, people won’t assume you lost weight. They saw you buy the jeans, and if they “fit you then,” it makes sense they fit you now. Only buy 1-2 jeans at a time until your goal weight.6. NEVER tell people what size jeans you wear. You can try to fool their eyes, but numbers give you away.7. Buy belts that have infinite sizes, not definite holes. If they don’t fit you later on and you try to punch a hole in them, people will notice8. If you somehow end up hearing the comment “you haven’t eaten all day” and someone offers you something, take it. It’s only a temporary gain, and not taking it will raise suspicions. Eating speeds up your metabolism, never fear this.Stay safe everyone, and ALWAYS eat something when you feel sick, dizzy, or faint! 

Cons:Becoming isolated and asocialBecoming depressedBeing moody and crankyBeing tiredSmelling like a vomit (if you purge)Ruining your digestionNot being able to keep up with everyoneNot being able to maintain relationshipsChipping nails, falling hairDark circles under eyesFoggy mindBad breathBad memoryDamaged teethLosing friendsLosing your mind Your life is literally only about foodNot being able to think about anything else than foodSpending ridiculous money on binge foodsWeak bonesAging skinI could go on for daysPros:Literally nothing.

Loving yourself is hard! I’m so proud of you for trying! Even though it is a long process, baby steps are still progress! Keep going! 

Progress is progress. Be proud of yourself, no matter how far you are in your recovery.  

When you want to eat and your ED is likeBut instead you’re like  

why do people want to find anorexia so beautiful and painless. where is the ugly truths about the pain you’ll feel, the truth about how after days of fasting despite how good u feel mentally, ur probably gonna spend ur days in bed clutching ur stomach because of the pain, how if you go long enough you’ll be puking stomach acid out of your nose, about how if you go even longer the stomach acid gets practically pissed out of ur ass instead because there’s no food to help get rid of it. the irritability, irrationality, meanness, and the manic emotions you’ll feel. how you’re gonna lose all your friends because nobody wants to sit and watch you die anymore as you refuse help, how nobody is ever gonna want you romantically for more than a few months because that ugliness is going to rip up right out of you and show its face in the light of day and you’ll prove yourself as too much to handle. how you’re going to be so cold, especially after all these people leave and there’s no ones body heat to steal anymore. the truth about how you can lose so much weight and still somehow never see the progress yourself because the feeling of being fat and the distorted body image follows you forever. i could go on. i really could. this isn’t beautiful. it’s ugly.

                what they don’t tell you about recovery            


recovery may feel so slow that you can’t tell you are going forward at all. sometimes it might feel like you are going backwards. but I promise, if you want to get better, you are already choosing to recover. it will be hard, but go at your own pace and don’t be afraid to ask for help. 

Recovery is hard and ugly and crying at 3am and relapsing at 2am. Recovery is looking at yourself and screaming because you hate what you see.Recovery is slowly, so, so, so slowly building yourself back up enough so you can stand yourself again.Recovery is not loving yourself again right away.Recovery might be going outside and soaking up the sun with friends and laughter, but recovery might also just be going to school, or getting out of bed or making your own breakfast.Recovery is a hard process that everyone one of us will experience differently and that’s okay. 

Stop putting thinspo/meanspo/diets in the recovery tags 

progress unnoticed is still progress. recovery is for you, not for what other people will think about you.

Honestly, restricting is my self care.When I restrict, my hygiene Is better. I put more effort into my appearance. My skin is clearer. I get work done faster. I am more organized. I feel mentally lighter and my head is clearer. This disease is fucking me up. 

i’m glad you’re alive 

appreciation post okay but can we talk about how genuinely body positive the ed community on tumblr is?? like yeah we post a lot of thinspo and say it’s perfection, but also anyone who says “i’m a whale and i’m worthless” is met with a wave of people telling them they’re beautiful and important and actually mean it. we’re not a bunch of malnourished bitches telling each other to starve, it’s actually the opposite. i’m on this site every day, and every day i see “it’s okay, angel, everything will be okay” and “please make sure you drink plenty of water and eat what you can” and “it’s okay that you binged,  you won’t lose progress, please don’t purge pure too precious” and there’s such a sense of community that people outside just don’t see. 

But the thing is…I don’t care how big the thigh gap gets or not. For once I would just like to be able to walk…Without.My thighs.Touching  

Things to do when things are shit and nobody can help right now- Take a shower.- Sing in the shower. - Listen to your favorite Music.- Listen to your favorite Movie’s Soundtrack. - Look up fanart of your favorite characters.- Actually watch your favorite Movie.- Sing a Song.- Find new songs. - Watch a new Movie.- Read a book.- Write your Feelings down.- Draw something nice.- Hug a Person.- Hug a Teddy.- Water a Flower.- Eat something delicious.- Try a new food.- Play a game.- Go for a walk.- Take a few Pictures.- Visit a new Place.- Make travel plans.- Ask yourself what you need. - Be kind to yourself.- Forgive yourself.- Try again tomorrow.Mostly meant for myself to remember, but hopefully it helps you too! ♡ 

YOU ARE VALID NO MATTER WHAT WEIGHT YOU ARE!!! 

i want to look sick.i want to be so bony that people worry, i want people to not let me sit on their laps because im so bony. i want people to stare at my arms whenever i take off my sweater because theyre so tiny. i want to be so skinny that i scare people.  

me: i’ll relapse. i can’t handle this. i’m not eating anymore. food is evil. i’m a dirty disgusting pig and i don’t want to be it anymore.my mom: *buys me my favorite sandwich*me: oink oink 

I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.I’m not binging, I’m cheating and boosting my metabolism.*Repeat it to myself until I believe it and not feeling like a fat pig with no control over itself* 

I finally told my mom about my ed🎉And honestly her reaction couldn’t be better i love her so much and she’s going to take me to the doctor tomorrow and I’m finally motivated to recover❤️ im just so fucking tired of having no energy for nothing and weighing out salad. I just want to live again ✨ im not going to be as active on here but i might post some recovery updates in the future

the media: look at this poor girl. she starves herself so she has some form of control in her life. her eating disorder in no way has anything to do with her actual body and how she looks-tumblr anas: nêêd the skinnï  

what they did to me is not a reflection of my worth.  

You’ve got to love yourself. You’ve got to wake up early and watch the sunrise and just be. You gotta go out with friends and smile and laugh. Love everything else first. Love the way the wind blows through the leaves, and the way the clouds look in the sky. Love the way the headlights look late at night, love the way little kids run around as if there is nothing else. Love everything in the world. Then eventually, you’ll realize you are part of everything too. 

Building up your self-esteem takes time. Loving yourself takes time, and that’s okay. Go as fast or as slow as you need to, take baby steps, and be proud of the little accomplishments along the way. You’ll get there one day, I promise.

I know we all want to lose weight, but please be safe and take care of yourself— if you are going to restrict/fast, please try to reduce harm to yourself as much as possibleI love this community so much. please take care of yourselves, and please always know that you can reach out to me if you need to talk. 🌸

This is part one of a series I’m doing to share everything I have learned as a newly independent person recovering from an eating disorder- hope it helps!

The best thing you can do for your grocery budget is PLAN your meals out before shopping. This way, you will have every ingredient you need, and nothing you don’t, saving time and money. Meal planning helped me take control of my recovery because my dietitian and I could put together a plan that let me know I was on the right track. Here is what I do each week to plan my meals-1. Make a calendar. Just make grid on a piece of paper with a box for each day that you want your meal plan to last. I go grocery shopping weekly, so I plan my meals to last one week. I find this works best for buying produce because it normally spoils if you try two weeks. Keep this paper so you know what meals you have available each day.2. Look through what you have. Look for any produce or dairy about to spoil or non perishables that are taking up too much room in your pantry. The key here is to look for recipes that incorporate those ingredients you have, cutting food waste and saving you money. I just search “(ingredient) recipe” on Pinterest or google to find a way to use the food. For example, just adding a soft boiled egg, carrot, and soy sauce to that old packet of ramen noodles makes a quick, easy, and delicious lunch!3. Fill in nutritional gaps. Hopefully you were able to 3 to 4 dinners out of what you already have without adding too many things to the grocery list. Now, look through what recipes you came up with. What is missing? Carbs? Veggies? For the rest of the week, add meals that balance your diet. I try to have at least one meal from each continent for variety.4. Lunch can be leftovers. I save money by making big dinners that can be tomorrow’s lunch. It’s much cheaper to make one big meal than two small ones!5. Add the basics. At this point, you have seven dinners planned, and your grocery list includes everything you need to make those seven dinners/lunches. Now you add anything else you need for the week, like snacks! At the end of every grocery list, I normally write eggs, bread, soymilk, chips, any anything else I like to have on hand like dried black beans and rice. (Honestly, just buy a giant sack of rice from an Asian market so you never have to worry about getting enough carbs again)And you’re done! Now you are ready for part 2- going to the grocery store! 

🌸✨Self care reminders✨🌸🌸Drink your water. Not just one glass. At least 8-12. Carry a bottle with you everywhere. Get a Reusable one so you are saving the environment and staying hydrated! ✨Get at least 8 hours of sleep every night. I know it may be hard but try melatonin. Also try not to use your phone or laptop about 30 minutes before bed time. 🌸 Take your meds! Set reminders on your phone or use post it notes or use a white board marker to write on your mirror. ✨ Exfoliat your body at least once a week. Of course this depends on your skin type but you want to make sure you are getting rid of access dead skin. 🌸 MOISTURIZE! I’m not kidding. Use body lotion and facial moisturizer. You want soft skin don’t you? ✨ Try to walk for at least 10-30 minutes a day. Trust me. It will help you loose weight,clear your head, and of cours if you have a fur baby take them with you if you can! 🌸 Keep a journal. Right down your thoughts. It doesn’t even have to be on paper. Type it out on your computer or use tumblr as a journal. (If you do use tumblr and something may be trigger, use a warning)✨ Feel like you are going to self harm? There are apps that can actually help you through it, and help you calm down. If you can’t use them because your parents go through your phone try to take up a hobby. I sew or knit when I get the urge. It helps me focuse on something specific that takes attention to detail. 🌸 Make sure to clean your glasses. I know it sounds small but it keeps the lenses nice and clean. Clean the frame too. Use lens cleaner for the lenses and wipe down the temples of the frame with a lens cloth. ✨ Try to clean one section of your room a day. It doesn’t matter if all you do is change your sheets, dust a shelf, or pick up clothes off the floor. That part will be clean. If you can try to have one day a week where you clean the entire room. Deep clean two times a month. One time a month try to go through clothes and give away things you don’t wear. 🌸✨These have all really helped me. As someone with anxiety, clinical depression, an eating disorder, schizophrenia, and sensory issues it’s really hard to just jump right into this stuff. Self care can take time and that’s ok. Even if you do one of these a day you are still making an effort and that is something amazing. Ease into it. Try to make it a routine. If you have any tips you’d like to add please feel free. I love you all. You are valid. You are loved. You are amazing. ✨🌸

You have a good body! You don’t have to be handsome or pretty or cute to have a good body. You don’t have to worry with those labels right now. You can take it all one step at a time, or decide you don’t care about those things at all. But, your body is good. It exists, therefore it is good.

Having an ED is like having an angel and a devil on each shoulder, but never knowing which one is which.  

you might not be where you want to be, but also consider how far you have come. you are better, stronger and braver than ever. when we look at how far we have come, it makes us less inclined to fall back into old ways. be proud of yourself. you’re getting closer and closer with every step and i couldn’t be more proud of you.

Depression isn’t pretty. But having depression doesn’t make you ugly. Anxiety is a burden. But having anxiety doesn’t make you a burden. Eating disorders are punishing. But having an eating disorder doesn’t mean you should be punished.You aren’t your problems. You deserve respect and patience. 

wouldn’t it be lovely? 

sometimes i think i don’t have an eating disorder because i’m not that skinny and sometimes i love to eat and it seems like i could recover at any timebut then i remember that it’s not normal to sob uncontrollably after eating a few candy bars and then immediately try to run off the calories and attempt to make yourself vomit, but fail and continue to sob. i remember that it’s not normal to constantly take laxatives and to be on the toilet literally every day at around 4 am crying because it hurts so bad and then pretending like nothing happened later that day at school. i remember that it’s not normal to try to calculate the calories in a single m&m or to chew up cupcakes and spit them out just because you miss the way it felt to eat something fattening. it’s not normal. even if you have a healthy/overweight bmi, don’t dismiss your strugglesif you need anyone to talk to, i’m always here 💘

i wonder how many of the girls on the thinspo/bonespo pictures that are being shared everywhere are dead nowi wonder how many ed blog owners that seemingly disappeared and deactivated are dead nowi wonder how many of these people who reached their ugw are dead now because they went further instead of living like these stupid ass “imagine waking up at your ugw” posts 

 

How i lost 12lbs (5kg) in two weeks whilst living at home with a cautious mother: DISCLAIMER. I am not pro ana. I will never be pro ana, i want everybody to recover eventually. This is my way of feeling control about my situation and I’m writing a post i can look at if i feel like i am slipping. These are not guaranteed to work for everybody. This is what worked for me and i am sharing my feelings and thoughts and experiences. Stay safe 💖🌱DIET~I am a vegetarian, so i dont eat meat, with the exception to tuna in sushi because its my favourite food and cant give it up. I only have it once a month if that though, this is good if the rest of your family eats meat, so you can offer to cook your own meals, which makes working out the calories significantly easier. ~i stick to 100-300 calories a day and fast one day a week, no cheat days. This is difficult to do, and i gradually got there, i dont advise restricting heavily right off the bat. ~i drink 3 litres of plain, ice water a day and either in the morning or before i go to bed have 1 litre of lemon ice water. This sounds like a lot, but the way I manage is i got a litre drink bottle so i only have to fill it up a few times, and it has a straw so i dont have to really think about it and can sip whilst doing homework or anything like that. I take 15 sips every time i go for a drink, it goes down quicker than you’d think. ~i have a teaspoon of peanut butter right before i go to bed too to boost my metabolism. ~green tea. I know this is stereotypical but it really does help me, and i happen to really love the taste. Some other alternatives to green tea i enjoy are peppermint, and even a loose leaf black and unsweetened earl grey tea are all fantastic for weight loss and boosting your metabolism. 🧘🏼‍♀️EXERCISE // BURNING EXTRA CALORIES~i get 10,000 steps a day, no excuses. If i dont quite hit 10,000 during my day walking around the city/school i take my dogs for a walk or pace up and down in my room checking my steps on myfitnesspal. ~fidgeting! I have ADHD so fidgeting comes more naturally to me than some and was prone to fidget beforehand anyway, but it does burn calories, leg shaking, hair fidgeting, thumb twiddling, literally anything. ~ the dreaded cold shower. I know some people REFUSE to do this. It’s winter where i live so it’s especially more difficult. However i found the best method, is to start of warm and gradually get colder, its like people say when boiling lobsters how if you just threw them into a hot pot they’d put up a fight and jump out but if you slowly boil it whilst they’re in there they dont even realise they’re being cooked alive. (Sorry for that morbid statement) but the same works in reverse. Once it’s cold set a timer for 5 minutes and have the cold shower, in this time let your conditioner sit in your hair or if youre feeling brave wash your hair in the cold water! I personally cant get my head cold in the shower that kills but washing your hair in cold water is better for it anyway. Then after the 5 minutes is up hit it on warm again for 2 minutes  and it will feel so much nicer. ~my daily workout consists of 100 sit-ups, 40 squats, 60 lunges (30 each leg) 40 calf raises, 100 second wall sit, 100 jumping jacks, 40 sumo squats, 30 leg raises (15 each leg) incase you couldn’t tell, i really hate my legs and trying to tone them up. ~use a spikey ball/roller! I roll this on my calves and thighs to release all the toxins building up in my legs before i go to bed and so far it’s helped me drop nearly 2 inches around my calves. ~stretching! I look up yoga workouts 3 times a week to stretch out my body and its great. ~singing, each song can burn around 10-20 calories, especially in the shower depending on pitch and all that stuff. ~sleeping in a cold room, your body will burn calories whilst you sleep anyway but the colder you are the more you’ll burn because your body will try to keep itself warm and burns calories trying to do that. 💪🏻MOTIVATION~i talk to an ana buddy on kik and we set reminders to tell each other to keep drinking water and making sure we’re both mentally okay and staying safe whilst sharing our progress. She’s fantastic. ~thinspo, i check thinspo every single day on tumblr first thing when i wake up and scroll through finding pictures to save whenever i can, on the bus, before i go to bed, watching tv, reminding myself of what i want. ~i set thinspo as my wallpaper, but so that nobody is suspicious i set it to a celebrity that i admire or an outfit i really like incase anybody asks why skinny legs are my wallpaper ~i allow myself to purchase one small item on wish or eBay for a few dollars if i stick to my goal, something that makes me feel good. 🤫OTHER ~if i know my mums coming home after me i make my own dinner that is incredibly low calorie but still make enough dishes to prove i made something more filling as she is trying to make me eat 3 meals a day even though she knows breakfast has made me ill since i was a kid. ~if i feel like binging, i wait until i am home alone (and mostly i buy my own binge food so i dont feel bad about wasting my mums money) i go to my room and chew and spit everything. Making sure not to swallow a bite so I’m still getting the taste, i do that until my mouth hurts from being cut on chips and then immediately drink a litre of water and drink tea and then brush my teeth. I have never actually binged thanks to this. ~i keep a toothbrush and whitening toothpaste in my bag (because i also smoke) but whitening toothpastes, especially the one i use is so minty and strong and makes my teeth look so nice i dont want to ruin my nice breath or looking teeth by eating it keep the urge to eat especially at school at bay~i still take food to school so my mum doesn’t get suspicious about not taking anything, i then either give it to homeless people, save it for my “fake binges” later or if its within my calorie limit for the day and i know i can make my own low calorie dinner later ill eat it. ~i carry peppermint tea and green tea with me at all times, both are hunger suppressants. And thats about everything i did, in another two weeks i might almost be at my UGW ^-^  

ANA PLAYLISTas I said, there is my playlist for whenever I wanna binge or give up! 💖 cars clothes and calories — blackbear💖 go to sleep —  bearson ft kailee morgue💖 american money — borns💖 empty — olivia o’brian💖 pretty hurts — beyoncé 💖 the less I know the better — tame impala 💖 paper bag — fiona apple 💖 happy pills — weathers 💖 six feet under — billie eilish 💖 I hope your whole life sux — blackbearthats it! hope y’all enjoy it! all those songs are very important to me.* not all songs are about eating disorders, tbh almost none, anyways it makes me think about other things than food* stay safe loves, xoxo

one day, when the sun kisses your bare skin, you will no longer fear feeling exposed. the rays will dance on your exposed legs and warm your back with their kind touches. you will laugh as waves splash mist into your face and point out tiny silver fish to your companion and buy ice cream from the little stand on the boardwalk. you will lie in the sunlight in your swimsuit and smile, remembering how far you have come. once upon a time you cried when you looked in the mirror and when you stepped on a scale. you hated every bit of food that crossed your lips and wished you could count your ribs like matchsticks. you could hardly stand to show your face in public, let alone strut half-naked on the beach. but here you are.alive, surviving, recovering, happy. the journey was not an easy one by any means, and there are still hurdles you will have to overcome.but here you are, finally free.

Do everything you can to stay away from toxic communities. That might mean staying away from the internet when you’re feeling vulnerable, deleting blogs you’ve made that are harmful, or avoiding people who are making your issues worse. You don’t owe communities or people who are hurting you anything. Get out of there as soon as you can. You deserve space to heal.  

Please take a momentWhether you’re in recovery or notWhether you’re 90lbs or 300lbsWhether you eat nothing or everything or somewhere in betweenWhether you purge, binge, restrict, fast, exercise or sleep all dayWhether you’ve eaten today or notI don’t give a damnPlease just remember that these disorders fuck your headspace and self perception over completelyAnd no matter how fat you may feel right nowYou will always be smaller than you thinkAnd you can always ask for helpYou can always get betterAnd you can always try again——Please just look after yourself 

for every like / reblog this gets I’ll go a day without binging & purging help a girl out pls 💛 

Don’t.Use.Pro.Recovery. Tags.On.Meanspo.Or thinspoOr sweespoAnd sure as hell not bonespo!Look I don’t care if you are ‘pro recovery’. You are posting to a tag that people who are considering/are in recovery search through, and these things can seriously trigger people.  

me in ed hell: obsesses over food, hardly thinks about anything else, hates myself, wants to fade away, lots of other stuff that should not be shared, “this sucks and I want it to stop”me in recovery: I was faking the whole thing, my ed was made up and I never truly had one, I need to try again and be sicker this time. you can eat “normally” right now because you are a liar, not because you have made significant progress managing your mental health. this makes perfect and complete logical sense.

Having an ed is weird because all of a sudden when you get extreme hunger pains, its no longer painful. Its just validating.  

REMINDER: the more you restrict yourself the higher the chances of you eating more than recommended later on. this is basic science. your body will do this whether you like it or not. Do Not Restrict. 

Reasons To Recover from your EDThicker, softer, and healthier hair Curves 😉Better skin Enjoying your favourite foods again😋No more panic attacks in the changing roomNo more panic attacks after eating Feeling energized after workouts instead of feeling faint To say I did it. Recovery is hard but it’s worth it.So your loved ones don’t worry Cake on your birthday 🎂 To be a beacon for others who are in a dark placeTo post your own food porn To order whatever the fuck you want at Starbucks 😂☕️No more burning in the back of your throat after a purge No more hunger pangs To be able to order at restaurants when you go out with friends To stop fucking up your metabolism Start to shut off the calculator in your head Clean smelling breath let’s  be honest purging and starving make your breath rankWhiter teethTo find love within yourself 💕To stop crying yourself to sleep over your bodyTo have you significant other hold you, and tell you how proud they are of you, and how beautiful you areTo repair your self image To stop comparing yourself No more hanger To live instead of survive So you can nourish you body To make all the people who tell you to “just eat a burger” shut up To fight that little voice To being to stop putting yourself down To realize your body isn’t the enemy your disorder isTo truly take care of yourself, not that “drink lots of water to stay full” bullshit but for real drink lots of waterNo more feeling guilty for your biology. Being able to have children someday Turn pain into powerTo forgive yourself Trust me babe, recovery is possible you can do it ❤️

relapses are gonna happen and when they do you can’t beat yourself up about it. after all, it makes perfect sense that when you’re emotionally distressed you’ll want to go back to what feels safe. however!!! if this keeps happening, if this relapse becomes more than just a one-time mistake, you need to seek help again. It sucks to not be as recovered as you thought you were, but there is no shame in asking for some extra support when you need it. A relapse is just your brain telling you that you have some shit to work through. You aren’t a hypocrite for promoting recovery and then having a relapse. You haven’t thrown all of your progress away. This post is mostly directed at myself because I’m shit at taking my own advice, but I’m being serious. I know a big part of ED brain can be about perfectionism, and buddy I’m here to tell you that your recovery doesn’t have to be perfect. It’s okay to mess up, and it’s okay to ask for help again.(honestly at this point I should just make a recovery blog but who has time for sideblogs amiright folks)

Me trying to eat a fear food. Originally posted by gif-007 

Very often, when people with eating disorders fear recovery, it is not really about the fear of weight gain, or the fear of foods. They might make it to be about that, both to others and to themselves, but truth is, it is often not that simple.It is a fear of losing your identity. You might feel as though you’ve become your struggle, and if your eating disorder left you thin, you might feel being “the thin one” is your identity or purpose.It is a fear of the expectations from others, and society, that comes when you are no longer ill (or “visibly ill”). Now you have to face the world, and you can no longer blame your illness.It is a fear of losing your coping mechanisms. An eating disorder is often a tool to deal with whatever curveball life has thrown at you.It is a fear of letting go of the stability and safety of eating disorder. All these rules and restriction might have given you a sense of predictability. Recovery is messy and unpredictable.But truth is, if something is trying to kill you it is not safe. If something leaves you miserable in the long run, it is not a healthy way to cope. If something leaves you isolated and unable to live a normal, rewarding life, it is not sustainable. Our worst enemies are the ones disguised as helpful friends. Please do not let the lies of an eating disorder seduce you to death. 

The crappy thing is I’ve spent the majority of my life believing I would kill myself eventually and now I’m having to do all these things that I told myself I would never have to worry about and I just don’t know how to handle it all, I don’t know how to handle still being here when all I thought for so long was that I would be gone by now. So when I’m struggling with tasks that you think are easy, please just be kind. We’re all learning these things as we go, together, but I’m also learning how to be okay with being alive.  

Every time I choose recovery over my ed I picture my organs cheering for me. So when I chose to eat breakfast this morning, my stomach did a little celebration. It’s a fun little recovery quirk that works for me, and might work for you 🌸

this only stresses me
 

Tips and sweetspo!Hello dear! I know that since it’s summer it’s quite difficult to lower your weight because there aren’t as many distractions, but here are some tips!1) Eat boiled eggs! They’re low calorie and taste really good with salt!2) Go to the library and read! Books are an amazing distraction for me!3) Walk outside! I’m pretty certain that walking will help you lose weight!4) Draw!! I’m constantly drawing!5) Decorate your room! It’s always refreshing to have a change!That’s all for today, I’ll be sure to post more tips! Remember, you’re beautiful and you don’t need to change yourself for anyone! I love you so much! Feel free to message me if you have any questions or want a friend! 

You don’t have to wait until your “super sick” to take the day off. You don’t have to “suck it up” and try to make it through the day.You can decide to rest because you have a cold. You can take a mental health sick day. Heck, you can take a mental health WELL DAY. Don’t let society pressure you into thinking you’re lazy for taking care of yourself.  

Did I seriously just ruin my day only because I ate 400 calories today? Since when did this become too much? 

FUCKI was sending memes to my friend in bulk and accidentally sent her this one AND NOW SHES ASKING WHAT ED MEANS AND I CANT TELL HER CAUSE SHE’LL BE CONCERNED THE IRONY OH MY 

Focus on your own health and happiness!There is nothing wrong with telling people you can’t do something because it will make you unhappy/unwell. Caring people will understand!  

PSAIf you’re like me and you don’t have time to make your own low cal meals.Lean Cuisine and Healthy Choice Simply Steamers are really good about low calorie meals. Last night I had a meal that was only 200 calories. These are the only meals I eat (when I do) and it holds me over all day. It also has small portions so I never get that horrible “full” feeling  Lean cuisine also has some vegan options as well ♥️Stay safe, loves  

~*imagine*~being friends with someone and thens t a y i n gfriends with someone 

Yesterday I was over at my boyfriends house and he kept asking me why I couldn’t sleep the night before (it was bc of the period problems I have been having, it was killing me inside) I told him that I don’t want to annoy him with my problems anymore but he kept asking and pushing me to say what’s wrong so I told him that my ED is causing my periods to stop and that if I don’t start eating more again, there’s a high chance that I will not be able to have children in the future. His face was heartbreaking to look at. Though we’ve only been together for 5 months, we keep talking about how our children would look like and stuff like that. And he keeps telling me how I’m the first person in his life he can imagine having kids with. He was like “Wait.. really? Oh.. shit.” And that’s when I realized that this ED is not only harming me, but the people around me. He asked me “And what can we do about that?” I told him I don’t know. I told him that it is impossible for me to eat more at the moment, because it would kill me mentally. I kinda poured my heart out at him though “ana” was screaming at me not to do it. He kinda is my strength and my anchor and venting to him is my only escape from this disease. He handled it all so well and said “well baby what about increasing your daily calorie intake to.. 500? not more. not less. Just 500. And you work yourself up step by step.” He could have said “Oh My GoD EaT MoRe HeRe eAt tHiS BaGel” but he didn’t. I don’t know what I did to deserve him. He’s so gentle with it all because he knows how sensitive I am and that I could break like glass any second. Anyways.. I lost 0.3kg since the last weigh in and I’m gonna try and not weigh myself till sunday. I am going clubbing today (I’m not drinking tho) and I’m scared kinda how my body will react to it since it’s gotten so weak. But I’m also excited to just get out.  

You’re gonna have bad days and it’s okay. If you’re having a bad day please don’t give up.  

me @ me when i accidentally told my therapist i felt fat 

I think one of the most dangerous things about the ana community for me is how kind it is. In some way, all of us probably suffered some kind of trauma or suffered through a toxic relationship with someone. For me it leads me to being shy, soft-spoken, non-confrontational, enduring. I’m used to having to deal with pain on my own that the thought of complaining about something out loud, or confronting someone about how they’re hurting me is so alien. I can’t call people out on rude behaviour, I can’t say mean things to someone and I can’t defend myself. My past has turned me into a bully’s ideal victim.Because a lot of people in the ana community are like this, its so easy to fit in. To find others that are so critical of themselves but wouldn’t dare say a bad thing to someone else. I also want to make clear that I don’t mean to say that we are better, or that this is at all a good thing.I interact with and see so many supportive people, so many positive vibes despite the large negativity inside us. Eating disorders have been romanticised, by ourselves, because its so much easier to cope that way. Rather than dealing with realities ugliness, you picture it into something beautiful. And in our lives there are people or concepts that have made us feel that we weren’t good enough. My mum makes me feel like I can’t do anything right, and unless I’m perfect I can’t gain her love. My teachers criticise me on not trying hard enough for the best grade. Even before ana my life was filled with so much perfectionism and aches to reach an unattainable goal. The message still rings in my head; I see no limit to perfect, the ladder keeps getting higher and higher. I’m not beautiful enoughI’m not thin enoughI’m not smart enoughI’m not motivated enoughI’m not fashionable enoughI’m not kind enoughI’m not funny enoughI’m not happy enoughI’m not relaxed enoughits always ringing and ringing and I feel my peers’ hateful, envious glances.I’m not good enough, but I’m better than them. In some way I know my grades are above average, my looks are a bit above average and whilst I’m no near close enough to being skinny my wrists, thighs and tummy and smaller than hers. Outside of Tumblr theres so much screaming, so many insults and all either thrown at me or people around me. Its so chaotic and I can’t force a smile at someone without them criticising me. I can’t give someone a compliment without them throwing it back at me, claiming I was being sarcastic and what a bitch I look. And honestly it scares me, everytime someone raises their voice or casts an annoyed sneer or raises their arms slightly I flinch and I’m terrified and I wonder “What have I messed up this time? What’s wrong with me? How can I please them? How can I undo what I did wrong?”Reality is getting so violent right now. Maybe one day I’ll learn to cope with it and face my fears…but for now I think I’ll stay tucked in this safe, cozy space filled with kind words and pretty images 🌸

sending big hugs out to everyone who has an eating disorder this easter. I know that a lot of families revolve their festivities around food and that can be incredibly stressful for people who are struggling. it’s okay to be struggling. it’s okay to tell someone why you’re distressed. you can make it through this holiday and all the next until one day they aren’t as hard to deal with anymore. 

 

I understand people who are hesitant to start recovery because a large aspect of their identity revolves around their condition, and people who are afraid to recover because they’re comfortable with suffering at the hands of their illness and they know nothing else. I’ve been there before. What I truly don’t understand it the people who think that recovery and and making an effort to heal from your illness somehow makes you neurotypical. It propagates a regressive mindset, and stagnates any potential progress towards living a happy, fulfilling life. Even if you’re not in recovery, please encourage those around you who are suffering to seek help. It’s fine if you can’t commit towards growing and healing yet. Recovery is a very personal journey, and it has to be a conscious choice on your behalf. But please, I’m begging you, don’t push an anti-recovery mindset onto those who are also struggling.  

Yall gotta understand that eating disorders do not discriminate. they can strike at any age, any gender, any size, any race. they aren’t just skinny, white, middle-class teenage girls. not all eating disorders are anorexia and bulimia. binge-eating, EDNOS/OSFED, pica, avoidance, orthorexia…the list goes on. you can’t tell if someone is sick by looking at them. the idea that eating disorders always look a certain way causes so much damage to those who do not fit the stereotypical “ED look.” A major issue I had when getting help was thinking that I wasn’t sick enough to need it. I don’t look like I have an ED, I’m not rail-thin or white or sixteen. I don’t have a traumatic past, I am still mostly functional. I don’t need help because I’m not that bad yet.Bull. Shit.eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. eating disorders do not have sizes. EATING DISORDERS DO NOT HAVE SIZES.you deserve help. you deserve to live your life free from obsessing and worrying and planning and weighing. even if you don’f fit the “type,” even if you think your ED “isn’t that bad.” any amount of ED is bad. any severity deserves to feel better. be brave. be free. 

You’ve come so far! Keep going! I believe in you. 

Depression: You must suffer!Anorexia: Bitch, STARVE!Anxiety: My body’s going to get so worse I can’t deal with how I’m ruining myselfMe: Yeah I’m okay :) 

its really easy to spot other people with eating disorders irl

It’s not failure. It’s just reality.Sometimes things don’t work out or they don’t go the way you’d hoped. But that doesn’t mean you’ve failed. That doesn’t mean you yourself are a failure, either. It’s just the reality of the situation. Don’t fall into the failure trap. Sometimes things just suck, but that doesn’t mean that you are at fault. Recognize what you can do to change things and accept what you can’t. It will be okay.

The worst feeling in the world is when you’ve been fasting all day and the second you go to eat something someone asks, “You’re actually gonna eat that?”

-So im 88 hrs into what i planned to be a 72 hr fast and i somehow feel amazing??? ive never surpassed 72 hrs and have always struggled to make it there so im not sure whats up but im not complaining bitches. This morning i reached my new lowest weight and honestly im going to try and make it to Monday before eating but I’m gonna be home alone all weekend so its gonna be difficult to not give in to temptation, especially bc my mom jusy went shopping and bought hella junk food. Anyways, i hope yall are doing amazing and are staying safe!! If anyone wants to talk maybe be ana/fasting buddies message me and my inbox is always open, id love to meet and talk to more people here!! xoxox ♥️♥️ 

 

The main reason I’m writing this are cause I really appreciate it when other people bring this up but it still isn’t talked about enough! EDs are glamorized so much, and only recently have begun to be properly represented. So here we go, here are my personal messed up experiences - crying when trying to find fancy dresses to galas and grad cause there was nothing pretty in my size and then once I lost weight crying because I still felt I looked ugly in the dresses- binging on my little sister’s halloween candy- feeling like all I do is waste my (and my parents) money because when I buy a nice dinner for myself and have a night alone, that dinner will end up flushed down the toilet - feeling like the girl I like is lying to me every time she calls me beautiful or hot- having my little 8 year old sister walk into me purging and watching her cry and ask what I was doing as she saw me with my hand down my fricking throat - my mom crying and asking what went wrong and why I have no control, why I can’t diet like a regular person - trying to awkwardly wash my hands and fix my makeup cause I’m at school but just couldn’t resist purging that dumb 300 cal starbucks drink which my friend had bought me and brought with the happiest smile - trying my best not to breakdown when someone makes an anorexia/bulimic joke - constantly smelling like puke - clogging the pipes at home and knowing that its all my fault- losing over 30lbs and still seeing myself exactly the same every time I look in the mirror because gotta love developing body dysmorphia - trying not to cry and breakdown whenever someone I haven’t seen in a while asks how I lost weight but rather have to swallow my tears, smile and laugh and say eating healthy and exercise-my hands are constantly cold and shaking (as I’m writing this rn)- feeling like I’m fake and don’t have an eating disorder- I get headaches so often - my grades dropping because I can never focus, remember anything, or I spend too much time and energy thinking about food and how I’m going to exercise instead of paying attention in class- dancing for 3 hours after not eating for 3 days and feeling like I was going to pass out, and in a really messed up way lowkey loving that -feeling a sense of accomplishment sometimes when I could see and mainly feel how sick I was getting - spending hours concealing the dark sunken bags I’ve developed under my eyes- not eating anything all day because I have plans at night which I know will involve eating- avoiding fear foods like crazy, before 2 weeks ago I hadn’t had pizza in over 3 months and a burger in over 5 months because I was so scared I’d purge them- insecurities about my body growing to insecurities on how I talk and act and therefore constantly trying to get people to like me - knowing the amount of calories in different brands of the same foods - staying up till 3am looking at thinspo and meanspo and hating how I look while crying my eyes out, wishing I had more self control- not being able to sleep because I can’t stop shaking or I’m getting hunger pains which hurt so much - literally crying over the toilet with my throat feeling raw, knuckles red, and feeling like a complete failure, guilty for all the people I let downI’m stopping there because the list seems too long but it only goes on. Please I beg, if you’re still new GET OUT and if you’ve dealt with the same then please please please consider recovery, I know it seems scary and awful for some but I promise it’s so so worth it. 💕 

My fav 😻Baked then Air Fried Brussel Sprouts w/ onion and bacon in a balsamic garlic glaze. Yes, I will be eating the entire tray thank you very much.  

Positive Message of the DayYou don’t have to bottle your feelings. There is no shame in seeking help and opening up to people when you need to. It doesn’t make you weak, it doesn’t make you annoying, it’s perfectly normal and necessary for your mental health. If you ever need someone to talk to, I’m always here!

Wanting and willing are two very different experiences.You can want good grades, but that means nothing without being willing to study.Similarly, you can want to recover from your eating disorder, but without being willing to change behaviours, gain weight, challenge rules etc etc, you are not going to get very far.On the other hand, you don’t have to want recovery (at least initially) in order to be willing to change. You can be willing to give gaining weight a go without wanting it. I can assure you that the majority of recovered people out there would agree that they didn’t necessarily want to make the painful changes that recovery demanded. But they were willing to try.Be willing to try something new. Be willing to have an extra bite of dinner, to sit down instead of run, to nourish rather than punish. It is far too easy to become trapped in a state of wanting and wishing change without taking any actions. It is not enough. Don’t let your illness trick you into thinking it is. 

I forgot people typically eat more than once a day oof  

 

If you’re one of those guys that fetishize eating disorders….go fall into a volcano

hi having an eating disorder sucks like I jUs want to fUcking eAt without thinking about how it will make me look later 

Thunderstorm-y morning with diner coffee: a mood 

Making friends in inpatient  

Ready?!Tip 1: See that plate of food? Eat it.Tip 2: Hear your friends and family calling you fat or ugly? Drop them.Tip 3: Want to hang out with people but it’s at a restaurant? Go.Tip 4: Find a cute, revealing outfit? Buy it.Don’t limit yourself or your beautiful body. Eat what you want. Stay healthy. Show off your gorgeous self. Have fun. Stay safe <3 

To my followers,If you do not have an eating disorder or are in the very beginning stages of one, please unfollow me, and seek help if you are dealing with an ED. I do not want to promote this life style or be the reason someone developed an ED. If you like my blog, I appreciate it, but I don’t want anyone to deal with this. This life isn’t glamorous or fun, its painful and heartbreaking and it absolutely destroys you in every way that matters. So PLEASE, unfollow if you don’t have an ED or if you are in it early enough to turn back! Thank you. 

 They feed off of you staying sick so that the blogger gets more followers, more notes, more comments.proana “anorexia support” groups don’t want you to get better. If they want you to post your food intake, body checks, weight, then they aren’t “pro” you. they’re pro attention.even if you aren’t in recovery, please recognize that you deserve a support group that supports you and supports you making healthy decisions. Not one that causes you to get even worse. Even if they have good intentions, they’re hurting you. They will make your disorder worse. Please don’t think that those groups ever really want you to recover. they don’t. 

When you find yourself wanting to go back to the things that ruined you it is time to ask what you are trying to avoid, what you are running from and what is stopping you from facing it.- An addiction is just as dangerous the second time round. 

lmao if it isn’t me. 👌

Me: ohh I lost 5 pounds in one week.My ed: You still looking fat bitch.Me: *cries in silence*My ed: Even if you cry, you still fat.

You’re not hungry.You’re bored. 

I weighed myself this morning (I know, I know. But some habits die hard) and I’m back to my highest weight. And… I’m fine. I’m sitting here eating a bowl of cereal and just chillin’ because I’m literally not bothered. I LOVE THIS. 

me binging as much as my stomach will humanly allow before I go on a two day fast— before realizing I’ll just be burning off binged calories and not fat:Originally posted by various-cartoon-awesomeness 

Things that keep me motivated:feeling proud when i turn down foods.seeing the numbers drop on the scale and the numbers of weight lost rise.the clothes i had been too scared to wear finally making an appearance.i don’t get anxious when ordering healthy food at a restaurant.feeling even a momentary shred of happiness when i go out with friends.for the moment when people ask if i’ve lost weight.one day feeling cute.people’s shocked expressions when i show them my before and after pictures in the future. 

When you find out you’ve reached your goal weight, but your mom found out at the same time as you.True story   

Things will all turn out okay, just breathe.  

Keep going for the colours of the sky and the feeling of loveit might be worth it 

I want my life backI hate this ed so much, I hate how I can‘t live a normal life. I hate being controlled by this fucking voice in my head.I want to go to a restaurant with my boyfriend like a normal couple and not start crying when he‘s begging me to eat.I want to go out with friends without worrying about calories. I want to eat dinner with my family without running to the bathroom afterwards.I don‘t want to weight my fucking blueberries anymore. I don‘t want to cancel plans because I ‚need‘ to burn a shitload of calories at the gym.I don‘t want to let the scale control every fucking day of my life. I‘m so tired. Loosing weight doesn‘t excite me anymore. I‘m just too scared of food. I want to enjoy life again but for gods sake I never thought that recovering would be so hard. But I‘ll try. Again. Again. Again. And Again.For my loved ones and for myself.  

My Rulesdon’t eat anything at school, unless it’s a special occasion or people are worrieddon’t eat after 7pmnever forget to exerciseexercise until you physically can’t anymorelook at thinspo for at least 30 minutes a dayeat as little as possible

okay, I know that I joke a lot about my ed. That's just how I cope but in all seriousness. For you who is new here in the ana community, it’s not as glamorous as you think. It’s not as funny as you think. It’s not some stupid diet. And I know that you probably will ignore this post (I know that I did). I won’t force you, it’s your decision, but please think for a moment. I beg you.the stressthe paranoiathe anxietythe depressionthe loss of friendsthe loss of familyand most importantly.the loss of lifeplease. just get off of Tumblr.eat a salad, give someone a hug, and give yourself a smilebut if you can’t do that, then I hope you will be as okay as possible, and you can always message me. I love you 

in Summer 2017 i was diagnosed with anorexia. i weighed 108 lbs for 5′7″, which was lower than my intial ugw, and i attempted suicide because i still felt too fat. i begged my family for professional help and started seeing a psychiatrist. doctors thought inpatient treatment wouldn’t be beneficial because i seemed motivated, i had just graduated high school with extremely good grades, and i was accepted in a really good school, so being hospitalized would have ruined it.i gained a bit, but not much - refeeding was hard. i stayed underweight for a good while - i was on the waiting list to see a nutritionist. when i started seeing her, she encouraged me to eat as much as i wanted. i started eating 6 small meals a day. i gained weight more rapidly. in September, i was considered physically recovered. my blood results were adequate, and i weighed 123 lbs.but i kept gaining weight, and it worried me a lot. in January 2018, i started seeing a dietician closer to where i lived. turned out i wasn’t eating properly at all. my weight was good, but i was eating too much, and not the right things. it freaked me out a lot, but the dietician gave me a personalized, balanced meal plan, and it helped me a lot. i stopped seeing the other nutritionist. i weighed 132 lbs.in Summer 2018, i was able to donate my blood. it felt good. my blood results were perfect, and i was healthy. i thought i worried less about my body, too. but then i was wrong. i don’t know what happened - i feel like i just looked in the mirror and saw all the weight i had put on appear on my body at once. my psychiatrist put me on anti depressants. they worked good i guess, but they also gave me horrible side effects - including night binging. i gained weight again. i tried restricting again in August. my boyfriend grew increasingly worried. eventually he convinced me to stop.in November, i was diagnosed with adenomyosis and endometriosis. i was devastated. wanting to have children someday was my main reason for recovering, and in the end my uterus was still fucked up, despite all my efforts. i relapsed and stopped my antidepressants brutally in an attempt to control my weight. my blood results were awful. i weighed 138 lbs.i kept having small periods of time where i’d try restricting, but living with parents who were very much aware of my diagnosis made it close to impossible, so the relapses were manageable. my immune system was shit, and i was severely anemic. a bad case of influenza in February made me lose 6 lbs. my dietician assured me that it was a perfect weight for my height, and that instead of focusing on losing weight, i should instead try and restore the muscle mass my anorexia had annihilated. i wasn’t convinced. i weighed around 132 lbs.in April 2019 i relapsed again. my therapist didn’t help, and i couldn’t bare to explain what was going on to my dietician or my parents. i knew they would just try to stop me, and they couldn’t help with what was going on in my head, so it was better to hide it all. i only talked about it with my fiancé, because i trusted him enough. i am still relapsing now. i have lost 6 lbs so far, and i keep lowering my calorie intake - since i still live with my parents, i still restrict at around 1000 calories, which is significantly higher than most anorexics, but - plot twist - is still very dangerous for your health.i am supposed to move in with my fiancé in 3 days, after 4 years of long distance relationship. yesterday evening he texted me this -“i want to live with you so bad, but i’m not so sure it’s a good idea anymore. i don’t know if i’ll be able to care for you. i am terrified that you’ll just kill yourself faster i we have our own place”you don’t know how much this hurts. this hurts more than a binge, or gaining weight. the person i love the most is scared to live with me because of my eating disorder. because of what i do to myself.recovery is really fucking hard, especially when you don’t get proper care. but please, please, please. there is no “i am pro recovery just not in it”. it’s a lie. you know you are sick. please get help. there is no other way out of this. your ugw is a lie. you won’t feel any better. i had reached my ugw. my pictures were being shared as thinspo - the most famous one was me in a pink bra, hands on my hips. i had the tumblr staff delete it for me because it was too painful seeing it passing around on my dash all day. i still attempted suicide because i. did. not. see. a. fucking. difference. you will never feel skinny, or pretty, or worthy of wearing cute clothes and bikinis. never. recovery is the only way and you know it.i know my story doesn’t seem good. it’s not a very good recovery story. hell, i’m posting food logs everyday. i know i’m not doing good. but if i had asked for proper help, if i had been honest with the professionals who were supposed to help me, i wouldn’t be like this now. it would still be hard, but not like that.i am losing the person i love the most because of this disorder. i still feel unable to stop. i don’t know what i’m gonna do and i feel like i am in too deep. but i am still gonna do my best because nobody deserves to be beat by this illness. not even me.you know what’s good for you. please try. 

My body: *exists*Me: Is there like any kinda way I can get rid of this?? 

doing my daily late night research, right before my psychiatrist appointment 

STOP using the “pro recovery” hashtag to post thinspo, meanspo, diets and other things that are obviously thematising an eating disorder (ED) while not preventing any sort of information or support for someone who tries to recover from it.It’s not “only a hashtag”.When a user searches for something encouraging on his/her journey to live a healthy life, the last things he/she wants to see are girls/boys who are highly underweight and posts about how 500 kcal a day are practically “binging”.Thank you. 

It’s okay to recover.It’s okay to gain weight.It’s okay; i’m okay.My life is not over because I have gained weight.The people I love are happier now that i’m healthier than they were when I was struggling.I am happier now in recovery.It’s okay to recover. 

If you’re struggling today, just know that I love you and you matter. Things may be hard one day, but tomorrow is always different. Hold on, and stay strong! 



This is part two of a series I’m doing to share everything I have learned as a newly independent person recovering from an eating disorder- hope it helps!

Going to the grocery store can be a traumatizing experience in recovery. When my dietitian gave me my first shopping list, it was the first time I had set foot in the “food” side of my local Wal-mart. It took me hours to pick out yogurt, breakfast bars, and fruit. Now, I buy food for three people in 40 minutes. Even if you struggle at first, choosing to bring the single thing you fear most into your home (food) is a major accomplishment in recovery. I am proud of everyone who makes the attempt. Here are my tips for going grocery shopping in recovery-1. Choose a small store. Eating Disorders LOVE to inspect labels. This is why I would spend hours in the store checking every label of package to find the product with the least c*lories, least sugar, least fat, etc. This is unhealthy. A small grocery store leaves you with fewer options, and this fewer opportunities to drive yourself crazy.My all time favorite grocery store is ALDI because it is dirt cheap and there are plenty of healthy foods. The business is also run in an ethical way, so you can feel good about shopping there. (Make sure to bring your own bags) There is only one brand, the store brand, so I can just pick out my food and go instead of inspecting labels.2. Make a list ahead of time. Grocery shopping for the first time in recovery is an unnerving experience. ED sufferers revert back to their ED’s in stressful situations, which is why I would often leave the grocery store with few items in my cart. Making a shopping list increases the likelihood that you will actually by food when you are there instead of running in fear. The more specific, the better. See pt. 1 on meal planning!3. Bring a friend. If you feel comfortable, bring someone who knows about what you’re going through to hold you accountable and help you through the trials. I once had a friend go shopping with me to cross out the calorie counts on all of the labels of the food I bought. (She was a blessing) I would recommend against shopping with someone who is ignorant to your circumstances, as people without ED’s, though not on purpose, tend to make unhelpful comments.I hope this helps! Now that you have purchased the groceries, you are ready for part three- cooking the food! 

LOW CAL CHIPS (25 CHIPS  ONLY 90 CAL!)Cut one slice of Flatout Original Flatbread into 25 pieces. (Each chip is about 3 calories)Brush a bit of water into the top rather than oil so the seasonings stick. You can use any seasonings of your choice, but I like a little garlic powder, some chili powder, paprika and salt.Preheat your oven to 350F and let them cook for about 15-30 minutes and there you go! Low cal chips! 

Since you need and excess of 3500 calories to increase (or decrese) 1 pound of fat, and since 1 kg is equal to 2.20462 lbs (according to Google), you need to consume 7716.17 calories to increase your weight by 1 kg.

Let me show you what 7716.17 calories a day looks like-:absolutely no movement in between:10 slices of pizza- 293610 slices of white bread- 53010 apples- 5206 eggs- 4603 chocolate muffins- 10922 coffee frappes- 1078500 grams chocolate ice-cream- 1080Caesar salad- 550PLUS eating whatever your RMR is (For Men : 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x Age + 5 = RMR ||| For Women : 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) – 5 x Age – 161 = RMR)So keep this is mind lovelies and stay safe, stay calm and message me if you need to talk

you’re allowed to gain weight and see it as a good thing. recovery that involves more than just maintaining is not bad. you are allowed to take up space and going back to a healthy way of living a lot of the time does mean taking up more space, even if you weren’t underweight to begin with. 

Like… Whaaaaat? 😭💔 

Reasons to be skinny• you can go clothes shopping literally anywhere and still have the size that fits •your partner can pick you up with ease •Partner wont feel grossed out when you’re intimate •you wont feel gross when you’re intimate•people to cuddle you because you’re just too cold •people get jealous seeing you on the street • thin = cute and dainty•no fat rolls!!! • you can post your own thinspo/aesthetics•easier to shave•take up less room •you wont get out of breath walking anywhere •friends wont be embarassed of you• no fat rolls when you bend over •you can store things in your collar bones 

just found out im gonna be forced to eat lasagna for dinner with my family tonight. its one of my biggest fear foods… but i cant refuse it & i cant purge. im terrified.i was on a 4+ day fast.. but i guess i have to end it at under 2 days. i just gotta work extra hard to make up for this.🌹i will stay on track🌹i cant afford not to  

Quick reminderYou don’t have to prove you’re sick by losing weight. Chances are, the people that love you already know that something’s not okay and there’s no need to make the situation worse. Reach out to people, they care. 

my sister: are you hungry?me, downing my green tea with vinegar, sucking on a cigarette while wearing five layers of clothes to keep myself warm: no, thank you for asking though!! :)

Life is a million times better when you aren’t hiding behind a bottle. 

When people ask you if you’re doing x diet.Originally posted by teamcoco 

🍃 

Don’t be mad if someone relapsesPlease don’t be mad if your loved one relapses. Relapse is a normal part of recovery. They are trying really hard to get better, but every now and than they just can’t. Not because they don’t want to. 

I don’t know if I’m the only one that does this, but when I go out to eat, I tend to eat a lot and I mean a lot. I out eat everyone at the table. It’s like I’m trying to show I have nothing wrong with me, that I don’t have a bad relationship with food, that I’m happy.  All it ends up doing is making me feel awful and hate myself.
 And I always get comments like, “How do you stay so skinny when you can eat so much?” 
I just laugh it off and say metabolism, but in the back of my head all I can think is, you’re not going to be/stay skinny if you keep eating like this. 

Doctor: 1200 calories is a healthy amount for calorie intake & human survival Me: bet 

If it feels wrong (even if just a little bit), it is wrong. If if takes away your peace (even if just a little bit), get away from it. You may get nostalgia from time to time for your old life, but remember what brought you to recovery: you weren’t happy.I prefer the peace and quiet of today to the loud misery I convinced myself I loved in the past. So I’m gonna do my best, day after day, to stay on it.  

Fuck my eating disorder . I need to lose weight. Not the unhealthy way but the healthy way. 3 healthy meals a day and 2L of water plus yoga in the morning and a workout before afternoon shower. I’m so sick of restricting, fasting, binging and purging. I want to eat what I want to eat without feeling shit about myself. I want to eat feeling satisfied. Self recovery is the best recovery and right now I’m ready to do so.  I not only want to lose weight but I want to become healthy , I don’t want to feel like shit crawling out of bed every morning . I don’t want to have zero modivation every single second of the day.today I started. Two meals down about to have the third.Breakfast was oats with honey banana and cinnamon.Lunch was tuna brown rice and quinoa salad And now dinner , chicken breast with roasted carrots and pumpkin. Suprisingly today I felt most content with myself, the most content in a long time. It was a relaxing day. I cleaned my room, had a shower, done washing, shopping , posted some things out and painted my little table. Even thought it doesn’t sound like much I felt really productive, the most productive I have in a long time. Eating the right food and drinking a lot of water really contributed to that. I felt like I could get things done I wasn’t overall sluggish like usual and I felt like my brain was actually working.When I was shopping I tried refraining myself from counting calories, calories are what triggers everything back. For weeks now I’ve been trying to get myself out of this fucked up situation, my fucked up mental state. Slowly I’ve been easing myself on to trying to get my eating habits back to normal.  Even though the next week could be me starving myself again I want this as a reminder for healthy weight loss not weight loss to damage my body , my mental state and my social life .I’m hoping this can be a place for me to post about what I eat and how I’m feeling. My own diary. Bts told me to fuck around and start loving myself, maybe this is why I’m doing this.  

sometimes good days happen, sometimes bad days happen. You just have to take them one day at a time 

what’s y’alls most ridiculous pre-weighing ritual? i have to remove any makeup and will exhale all the air from my lungs before stepping on the scalelike somehow oxygen and foundation being gone will bump me down to my gw haha  

me: *eats 1 calorie*me: oh my god. i cant believe ive been faking my ed this whole time. ive just been looking for attention havent i. wow i cant believe myself 

I got an anon ask asking me what purging wasIf you don’t know what purging is you’re probably new to the communityIf you’re new to the community please run far far away eating disorders ruin and take lives pleaseEd hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438Ed hotline number: 1-847-831-3438(This number is the American hotline and is the only one I know please reblog with ed hotlines for other countries that you know) 

Today marks 3 months since I decided to recover. It’s definitely been hard, and had its ups and downs, but honestly thank god I decided to recover. Who knows where I’d be at today if I hadn’t. 
To celebrate, I bought myself a set of oil pastels! I’ve never used them before, but I’ve been wanting to try them for a while. And, as it turns out, they’re so freakin fun! Almost as fun as acrylic painting is….which is saying a lot for me 😅
All in all, today I’ve been able to enjoy my recovery by eating what I wanted, not what my eating disorder wanted. For breakfast I had chocolate oats, for lunch a hummus avocado wrap, and for dinner some homemade pesto pasta! I enjoyed every second of every meal. Here to a long, amazing life full of good food and art ✨

💞RECOVERY 💞❗️Attention❗️Eating disorders are NOT cool. NOT pretty. NOT the right choice. NOT OK. Please try recovery💓💞Progress💞💓You can still have a thigh-gap and you can still be beautiful at 56kg 💗 And no matter what - you ARE beautifulMarch - 44kgNovember - 56kgDO NOT TAKE THIS AS «THINSPO», I AM JUST TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THAT CURSED ANA COMMUNITY.I wish I had more pictures of me back then, so that I could look at the progress I have made, but I deleted my blog soooo whatever. This is the only one of my entire body.My hands at 43kg(April) and 56kg(November). The old picture was a polaroid picture,that’s why it has such low quality. They haven’t changed that much, but at least I’m healthy now 💗💓Reasons to try recovery:You won’t be cold once you’ve recovered (of course you’ll be cold in certain situations, even I am)You won’t feel guilty after eating a normal mealYour concentration will get better (my concentration was horrible at the time)You can stand up without feeling like collapsingYou managed to get that thin, you’ll be able to gain as wellYour mental health will get betterYou may be able to have kids (I am, at least)Your hands and feet won’t be freezingYou can look back at your progress and feel greatYou’ll generally feel better(I am sorry if this triggers/offends anyone. I just want to help people in the same situation I was just months ago)Tips for recovery:Avoid thinspo, sweetspo, the pro ana/Mia tag, the anorexia/bulimia tag and ESPECIALLY THE MEANSPO TAGIf you have to look at something, look at fitspoTry taking tiny steps towards recovery (if your daily intake is 200kcal, try going up a hundred calories every day, or 50. If that is too hard, you can try going up 100 every week)Seek support from therapists, family, friends, teachers, etcWrite down your progress (if this is too much of a trigger, don’t)Don’t weigh yourself every day. If it is impossible for you, try every second day or every week. But try to avoid it at any cost.Quit using tumblr. Tumblr is a bad idea in the beginning, it contains all sorts of bad things.Get a new hobby. Distract yourself when you feel bad about your body, like you’d do when you WERE trying to avoid eating during a fast.Plan rewards (for example: at 46kg-new curtains, at 47kg-a new hoodie, at 48kg-new shoes) I remember that my dad told me that if I had gained 1kg, I’d get a new papir of pants. Those papir of pants are the ones I’m using in the second picture. Remove toxic people from your life. If people tell you that you’re ugly, ignore, report or go away. I know that this one can be hard, but it worked for me.DISCLAIMER: My type of anorexia was a little different from the one you might be having. It was partly caused by my Asperger’s syndrome, and that’s why I recovered so quickly. Recovery can take weeks, it can take months and it can take years. Anorexia symptomes may go away for a little, and come back later. Be prepared when they do. If you experience negative thoughts about your body, TALK TO SOMEONE. Get help, please 💓💓💓💗Stay safe~ 

Not doing well?It’s okay to have bad days, don’t let them control your life. Stay safe 🌼Open the window Clean your room Take a shower Wear clean clothes Stretch Drink some water Set your goals

Can this binge cycle end please? 

Because I only feel beautiful when my stomach is growling. 

can y'all believe that when normal people eat they don’t want to kill themselves after. wild. the fucking audacity. 

*my recipe* This is super good and it makes a big portion too! Reblog if you want me to post more of my low cal food discovery’s!!!Stay safe lovelies💕💕💕 

Malnutrition and bdone more text post for today…. I hate my body. HATE IT. but I am literally 15 years old. 15 YEARS OLD. I haven’t even fully grown into my body or personality. I have no aspirations or dreams aside day dreaming about Evan Peters being in an indie film (jc that sounds so fuckin cringe worthy buttt.) What I realized is that if I don’t eat enough, I won’t grow… and if I don’t grow I will hate my body even more…. it’s an endless cycle of hatred. Recovery is the only way you will see yourself for how beautiful you really are. just because you plan on getting to blah blah pounds doesn’t mean you are going to like yourself in fact you’ll feel even worse. The point is NUTURE YOUR BODY. EAT A SNACK. DO IT. BREAK YOUR FAST. YOU DESERVE TO FEEL SATISFIED AND HEALTHY. I’m still a kid, I haven’t even finished growing I GOTTA EAT. YOU GOTTA EAT. WE GOTTA EAT. 



5’8” — 97 lbs 

what to do after a relapse. so you’ve relapsed. that’s okay! it happens to a lot of people. you are still amazing, and deserving of recovery. you can recover, this is just a little slip up. first of all, you may feel like shit and not want to do anything, but the most important thing you can possibly do is to clean up any cuts. it doesn’t have to be rubbing alcohol and  gauze. i just put a tiny bit of soap on a paper towel or toilet paper, and gently dab and wipe at the area. bandage it up (if you can) wear short sleeves or shorts so there isn’t any fabric rubbing against your cuts. that’ll reopen them and gain more risk of infection. (if you’re alone)for the pain, take tylenol or advil or wrap some ice in a cloth and put it against the area (ONLY do this if you have bandages!! don’t do this on bare skin) call or text someone you trust. whenever it happens to me i talk to my best friend and she offers support and distractionsdistraction is key. if it’s painful or if you’re feeling depressed /guilty do something. it doesn’t have to be anything major, watch a new show online, talk to a friend. take care of yourself! Make sure you’ve eaten, take any necessary medications, drink some water. wait a bit to take a shower, but if the cuts are on your arms, baths are really nice. know that you are loved and supported by people, including me. ily all, please stay safe 💖💕💗💗💞 

hunger pangs make my heart go: 💝💘💖💗💓💞💕❤ 

My doctor:Me: My eating disorder: Me very unsure what the hell im supposed to be doing:

late night body check?? 

Do you ever just have your appointment with your Dr, psychologist, dietician or whoever your seeing. You’re sitting there complaining about being at x weight and the other person in the room is obviously bigger than you. So you’re just sitting like I am sorry I’m so shit and borderline insulting you.  

Make it stop.  

I want to recover to feel at home in my skin 

things to remember:• you’re gonna have days where you feel or look worse than others• you’re gonna have certain angles that make you look worse/better than others • those models you see everywhere are using angles/poses that work for them. They have bad angles too• food is literally life. It gives you the power and the energy to LIVE. There should be no shame in powering your body• it is completely OKAY to treat yourself to food. If you are wondering if you should have a bite of that food you’re craving, you should. • there are healthy ways to lose weight. you can eat any food you want and burn it off through exercise • you are perfect the way you are, but if there’s something you want to change, remember that you are valuable and take care of yourself

28 calorie tortillas!!Okay so I found a recipe for 25 calorie tortillas, which I found on YouTube  (at Ashley Halloween if you wanna look) but they were bitter (This could be due to the flour being white)After trying the recipe with the same results, I revised it a bit:-1.5 tbsp white flour (28 cal) (whole wheat/brown flour is 25 cal)-a pinch of baking soda-a pinch of salt-1 to 2.5 tbsp water (I forgot to measure this part)(You’ll want to preheat your pan onto a medium setting) (preferably on an nonstick pan so you don’t need the empty calories in cooking spray)Mix the ingredients together and stir well, until smoothCook until the edges begin to brown, then flip. Cook for approximately three minutes, and enjoy your low calorie tortilla!!(If you find anything important about this recipe, please let me know so I can fix it!!)💜💙 I love you all and stay safe 💙💜 

How do I tell the boy that I like that I want to own multiple dogs with him? 

You deserve food. Losing weight won’t make you feel better about your insecurities, you’ll just be malnourished and unhappy. Losing weight won’t make somebody love you and even if it did, you deserve someone who loves you and thinks you are gorgeous at every size. You deserve to be happy. You deserve nourishment. You deserve food. 

I am still trying to learn that this body does not have to be a means to confess my pain, that this body is just a body, that this body was never meant to be anything more or less than just a body. 

Eating disorder culture is accepting the food someone made for you out of the kindness of their heart and eating it with a forced smile and a thank you, only to think about how this is causing you to go over your calorie limit and that you’re probably going to gain weight from it.  

If you have even thought about not eating because you don’t like your body, that is an eating disorder. You are valid, your disorder is valid, your struggles are real and you deserve recovery. Stop saying you don’t because you don’t think your eating disorder is real or bad enough or because you don’t think you’re worth it. You truly are and I wish you luck. 💖

Does anyone else ever feel so disgusted with yourself after a binge you can’t bring yourself to look at Thinspo you’re so ashamed? Because that’s me rn.

I think one of the best pieces of mental health advice I have heard is just… respect yourself. Respect yourself when you do something wrong, when you wake up sad, after a binge, when you feel like cutting… all the time. Treat your body like you would treat a friend’s, even if you don’t feel like it. You don’t have to love yourself, that might be too hard. Treat yourself when you hate yourself, even if you feel like you don’t deserve it. It’s a healthy habit and will make you a better person. 

random things i’ve learned in residential ED treatmentyou dont have to be underweight to have an eating disorder life is so much better without EDthe strongest connections are made when you are vulnerable and honestyour only options are recovery or deathyou will die from your eating disorder, no matter how often it tells you “you’re not sick enough” you will never be “sick enough” for your eating disorder you are not alonei strongly encourage EVERYONE with an eating disorder to seek treatment. i know residential is tricky and expensive but for anyone who has that opportunity, please fucking take it. CFD changed my life entirely.  

How much do you REALLY burn?Later today I am going to be posting how many calories a specific exercise routine burns and debunking a lot of misconceptions with my new “fitbit” (it’s a knock off but good quality!)I’m 126.0 lbs & 5’5” If you’re curious to see how many calories an exercise routine burns just send them in my way!Let’s put the pedal to the test and see just how much metal we’re peddling, if you catch my drift!  

Me: you know sometimes I don’t feel too bad about my body like its decent, I could definitely eat a normal amount of calories and exercise to loose weight & be healthy!!!Also me: uhhh my nose looks fat, if I fast for a week maybe that will sort it. 

Soooooo….I talked (well, tried to talk) to my therapist about how I feel like I might be developing an ED. About how I’m restricting and fast and even consider purging on numerous occasions…And she just kinda brushed it off! Told me there were healthier ways to lose weight. LIKE I DON’T KNOW THAT. My guess is it’s because she’s got the same mindset at everybody else… “You’re FAT ,You can’t have an eating disorder..”……..can’t say I didn’t try{NOT MY PHOTO} 

Sometimes life throws so much at you, but that only makes you stronger. You are not weak! You are still alive and still fighting! Do not feel weak just because things get tough, you are anything but. 

Ok so I’ve been the doing the IU diet for a few days and guys not only did I get over my plateau, I lost over 4 lbs in two days, and I just reached a fully normal BMI??? I’m gonna cry??? 💫💕 

As hard as that can be, that is important and necessary. The company you keep does have an influence on how you act and feel. 

I’ve been binging A lot lately, but I am sort of starting to control it by eating low cal veggies instead. Anyway I hope this helps. 
~Pro Recovery~ 

Yes, some bulimics restrict between binges, as a method of “purging” calories, a subtype called non-purging bulimia.Yes, some anorexics have a subtype of anorexia nervosa in which they binge and purge, called binge purge subtypeBUT THEY ARE STILL TWO DIFFERENT EATING DISORDERSEven with subtypes, even if both disorders share the characteristic of fear of weight gain, they’re still NOT the same thing, as they differ greatly in diagnostic criteria and core behaviorsOnly a doctor can diagnose you with an eating disorder. Only a doctor can determine what kind of eating disorder you have. A doctor will, however, NOT diagnose you with both at the same time. If you have either anorexia or bulimia, they will diagnose you with one or the other. Or they may diagnose you with OSFED/EDNOS. But they aren’t going to diagnose you with more than one eating disorder at a time. That’s not how it works.It’s time we started recognizing the differences.

recovery becomes extremely difficult when the only thing that feels right and keeps you safe is your eating disorder.

Serdecznie zapraszam Was do zapoznania się z treścią tego posta. Przedstawione sposoby leczenia anoreksji są typowo podręcznikowe, co nie zawsze przekłada się na rzeczywistość. Warto jednak je znać — chociażby dla samego siebie lub żeby wiedzieć, jak może wyglądać ewentualne leczenie.Post dedykuję @m-a-k-k-u-r-o — pierwszej osobie z listy poleconych przeze mnie blogów.***Leczenie anoreksji jest procesem długim i trudnym. Z powodu braku jednoznacznych czynników powodujących zachorowanie na anoreksję, niemożliwie jest podjęcie najbardziej pożądanego sposobu leczenia w medycynie, czyli leczenia przyczynowego. Osoba chora, aby jeść, musi przezwyciężyć lęk przed przytyciem, wstręt do jedzenia oraz wszystkie negatywne emocje będące udziałem anoreksji. Organizm wyniszczony długotrwałą głodówką często nie może czekać na efekty psychoterapii — wymaga zdecydowanej i szybkiej interwencji. Z kolei psychoterapia, której skuteczność ściśle zależy od tego czy pacjent je, wymaga czasu. Osoba z anoreksją tak na prawdę musi nauczyć się jeść od nowa. Jest to swoista kwadratura koła — z jednej strony jedzenie, które stanowi o życiu i zdrowiu chorej/chorego, z drugiej choroba, która nie pozwala jeść. Leczenie komplikuje także fakt, że osoby cierpiące na anoreksję bardzo często zaprzeczają, że są chore i nie chcą się leczyć.Gdzie powinno się leczyć osoby chore na anoreksję?Obecnie przeważa pogląd, że leczenie powinno być podejmowane w pierwszej kolejności w trybie ambulatoryjnym. Leczenie szpitalne zastrzegane jest w przypadku pacjentów o bardzo niskim BMI, braku efektów stosowanego leczenia, złego stanu ogólnego, złej kondycji psychicznej (depresja, myśli i tendencje samobójcze). Pozostający w mniejszości zwolennicy wczesnej hospitalizacji, argumentują swoje zdanie, możliwością podjęcia na pierwszym etapie procedur behawioralnych, które mogą ułatwić przyjmowanie pokarmów. Jako zaletę leczenia szpitalnego wymienia się także możliwość oderwania chorej osoby od jej naturalnego środowiska, w którym wykształciła się choroba. Taka sytuacja stwarza jednak ryzyko, że po opuszczeniu szpitala powrót do tego środowiska może ponownie wyzwolić anoreksję.Główne cele leczenia anoreksji to:przywrócenie normalnej masy ciała, a także leczenie ewentualnych fizycznych następstw długotrwałego niedożywienia;leczenie problemów psychicznych związanych z zaburzonym jedzeniem;wyeliminowanie zachowań i myśli, które towarzyszyły zaburzonemu jedzeniu, głównie celem zapobiegnięcia nawrotowi choroby.

Dieta w leczeniu anoreksjiW leczeniu anoreksji sprawą priorytetową jest dostarczenie wygłodzonemu organizmowi wszystkich niezbędnych składników: odpowiedniej ilości wody, elektrolitów, białek, węglowodanów, tłuszczów oraz pierwiastków śladowych. W zależności od stanu fizycznego i psychicznego osoby chorej, zdolności organizmu do przyswajania pokarmów, chęci współpracy ze strony pacjenta, a także od tego w jakim trybie odbywa się leczenie istnieje kilka możliwości podawania składników odżywczych:doustnie — sposób ten najbardziej odpowiedni fizjologicznie, wiąże się też z najmniejszą ilością powikłań;dojelitowo — w przypadku, gdy pacjent nie jest w stanie sam jeść lub odmawia jedzenia zalecanych posiłków, a jego stan fizyczny wymaga szybkiej interwencji;przez sondę dożołądkową — jak wyżej;pozajelitowo (dożylnie) — często stosowane jako uzupełnienie pozostałych metod lub jako samodzielny sposób dożywiania w sytuacjach gdy stan osoby chorej jest szczególnie ciężki.W momencie gdy pacjent jest gotowy do powrotu do spożywania normalnych posiłków wprowadzany jest odpowiedni plan diety — z reguły złożony z kilku posiłków (5-6), stopniowo zwiększających swoją kaloryczność, w pierwszej fazie często w postaci płynnej. Pokarm musi być bogaty w substancje deficytowe (żelazo, witaminy, niektóre aminokwasy), lekkostrawny, zajmujący jak najmniejszą objętość. Z reguły żywienie zaczyna się od 1000-1500 kcal, dochodząc do 2-3 krotnie większych porcji. Przyrost masy ciała musi być na bieżąco kontrolowany, aby nie przekroczyć 1,5 kg na tydzień.Naczelną zasadą jest unikanie dokarmiania przymusowego, zastrzega się to do sytuacji wyjątkowych związanych z zagrożeniem życia. Powinno unikać się tworzenia nowych negatywnych skojarzeń z jedzeniem.

Leczenie farmakologiczne anoreksjiNiestety nie istnieje cudowny “lek na anoreksję”. Depresja i problemy emocjonalne związane z tym zaburzeniem odżywiania są przede wszystkim efektem głodzenia, dlatego w leczeniu uwaga koncentruje się głównie na zwiększeniu masy ciała osoby chorej. Lekarze decydują się na leczenie farmakologiczne dla zmniejszenia lęków związanych z jedzeniem i przytyciem, zwiększania szans powodzenia psychoterapii, poprawy nastroju, zmniejszenie ryzyka śmierci. Niezwykle istotne jest dopasowanie leków do stanu somatycznego pacjenta. Inne preparaty i inne dawki będą stosowane u osób z BMI równym 13, inne jeżeli będzie większe od 16.W leczeniu psychicznych konsekwencji anoreksji psychiatrzy zalecają stosowanie różnorodnych leków antydepresyjnych. Stare leki traktowane są jako skuteczniejsze w leczeniu zaburzeń nastroju, jednak z powodu licznych działań ubocznych należy stosować je z rozwagą. Z praktyki wynika, że leki trójpierścieniowe (starej generacji) są przeważnie doskonale tolerowane. W wielu źródłach zaleca się stosowanie SSRI (selektywnych inhibitorów wychwytu zwrotnego serotoniny), jednak ich przydatność w leczeniu wydaje się być wątpliwa ze względu na efekt uboczny polegający na ograniczaniu apetytu i prawdopodobnie mniejszą skuteczność. Zastosowanie znajdują również inne leki antydepresyjne np. mianseryna i mirtazapina. Efekt przeciwdepresyjny leków należy potraktować jako ograniczony. Leczenie farmakologiczne jest zdecydowanie bardziej skuteczne, jeżeli pacjent obok przyjmowania leków stosuje się do zalecanej diety i uczestniczy w psychoterapii.Popularną tendencją jest stosowanie również leków z innych grup, głównie w celu redukcji niepokoju, poprawy snu. W ostatnich latach coraz większą popularnością cieszą się nowoczesne neuroleptyki, głównie olanzapina i kwetiapina. Z badań wynika, że osoby leczone tymi lekami szybciej przybierają na wadze, zmniejsza się u nich ilość zachowań obsesyjno-kompulsywnych dotyczących jedzenia, lepiej współpracują w psychoterapii.Obecne w anoreksji zaburzenia hormonalne wymagają czasami leczenia suplementami. Problemem jest długotrwały brak miesiączki będący wyrazem zaburzenia funkcji przysadki. Aby zmniejszyć problemy hormonalne stosuje się głównie preparaty estrogenu.Duży nacisk kładzie się też na inne powikłanie anoreksji, czyli osteopenię, czyli zmniejszenie masy kostnej prowadzące w ostateczności do osteoporozy. Leczenie tego powikłania ogranicza się do odpowiedniej diety zawierającej odpowiednie ilości wapnia, witaminy D oraz przywrócenie prawidłowej czynności hormonalnej.

PsychoterapiaZasadniczą rolę w leczeniu anoreksji odgrywa psychoterapia. Istnieje wiele różnych szkół terapeutycznych, z których każda ma swoje wady i zalety. Wybór konkretnej metody powinien odbywać się w zależności od indywidualnej sytuacji danego pacjenta — jego wieku, stanu fizycznego i psychicznego, oraz zaangażowania najbliższych w proces leczenia.Terapia poznawczo-behawioralnaJest to najlepiej zbadany i najczęściej stosowany rodzaj terapii w leczeniu anoreksji. Polega on na rozpoznaniu negatywnych emocji, uczuć i myśli związanych z sylwetką, wagą i jedzeniem, które są odpowiedzialne za zachowania anorektyczne, a następnie zastąpienie ich zdrowym i realistycznym podejściem. Ważnym elementem terapii poznawczo-behawioralnej jest nauczenie osoby chorej jak radzić sobie z trudnymi, stresującymi sytuacjami w sposób niedestruktywny. Inne cele to:poprawa samooceny i poczucia kontroli,dokładne poznanie natury anoreksji ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem czynników, które wyzwalają anorektyczne myśli i zachowania oraz sposoby radzenia sobie z nimi.Terapia poznawczo-behawioralna koncentruje się na teraźniejszych uczuciach i emocjach, rozpatrując traumatyczne zdarzenia z przeszłości tylko w kontekście przenoszenia ich na teraźniejszą sytuację.Terapia psychodynamicznaW terapii psychodynamicznej głównym obszarem zainteresowania jest przeszłość i poszukiwanie w niej przyczyn anoreksji, która jest postrzegana jako sposób wyrażania konfliktów wewnętrznych w sferze seksualności, rywalizacji, problemów z usamodzielnianiem się, wszystkiego co dana osoba w sobie nie akceptuje. Główną rolę w terapii gra więź pomiędzy osobą chorą a terapeutą, a jej celem jest przeniesienie różnych istotnych zdarzeń, myśli i emocji, odpowiedzialnych za wykształcenie się anoreksji, na tą więź. Terapeuta pomaga interpretować te zdarzenia, a pacjent uczy się akceptować je, oraz radzić sobie z nimi.Terapia interpersonalnaTen rodzaj terapii traktuje anoreksję jako wyraz negatywnych emocji związanych z negatywnymi relacjami z innymi ludźmi. Głównym obiektem zainteresowania tego rodzaju terapii jest funkcjonowanie chorej osoby w związkach i relacjach z innymi ludźmi oraz jak wpływają one na uczucia tej osoby. W czasie terapii pacjent pod nadzorem terapeuty uczy się, jak radzić sobie z frustracją i napięciami pojawiającymi się w relacjach z innymi, oraz jak reagować na takie emocje jak np. żal spowodowany utratą bliskiej osoby, czy też negatywne uczucia towarzyszące konfliktom w związkach. Inne cele terapii interpersonalnej to budowanie poczucia własnej wartości pacjenta, jego pozytywnej samooceny, które pozwalają na lepsze funkcjonowanie w związkach i relacjach z innymi ludźmi.Terapia grupowaOsoby dotknięte anoreksją często czują się wyobcowane i niezrozumiane, więc ten rodzaj terapii stwarza możliwość kontaktu z innymi chorymi, którzy doskonale rozumieją tryby anorektycznego myślenia i zachowania. Terapia grupowa zwykle towarzyszy terapii indywidualnej, jako motywacja i wsparcie w procesie leczenia. W zależności od sposobu prowadzenia terapii grupowej możemy wyróżnić kilka różnych jej typów:poznawczo-behawioralne — oparte na takich samych zasadach jak terapia indywidualna przedstawiona powyżej;psychodynamiczne/interpersonalne — grupy funkcjonujące w oparciu o założenie, że zaburzenia odżywiania są efektem konfliktów wewnątrz danej osoby i w jej relacjach z innymi osobami, terapia polega na wyrażaniu tych konfliktów oraz poprzez budowanie samooceny pozwala uczestnikom na zaakceptowanie ich niedoskonałości oraz zdanie sobie sprawy, że otwarte wyrażanie emocji jest zdrowsze niż wyrażanie ich poprzez zaburzone odżywianie;psychoedukacyjne — grupy takie są zazwyczaj bardzo dokładnie zaplanowane, każde spotkanie ma określony temat przewodni, często są prowadzone w formie wykładów prowadzonych przez lidera grupy, z towarzyszącymi pytaniami i dyskusją uczestników, dodatkowo uczestniczy otrzymują zadania do samodzielnego wykonania oraz materiały uzupełniające treść spotkania;grupy samopomocy — formalnie nie są rodzajem terapii w tradycyjnym tego słowa znaczeniu, są prowadzone przez uczestników, a nie profesjonalistów, zaburzenia odżywiania są w nich traktowane jak uzależnienia (grupy samopomocy funkcjonują na zasadach takich jak np. grupy AA).Terapia rodzinnaNa wstępie należy podkreślić, że celem terapii rodzinnej nie jest obwinianie rodziców za zaburzenia odżywiania u ich dzieci. Anoreksja wpływa nie tylko na samą osobę chorą, ale także na całą rodzinę. Naturalną cechą każdej rodziny jest zachowanie stanu równowagi i stabilności. Gdy w rodzinie jest dziecko chore na anoreksję, jego zaburzone zachowania związane z jedzeniem zostają wplecione w funkcjonowanie rodziny, tworzy się nowa równowaga bardzo często koncentrująca się wokół anoreksji. W skrajnych przypadkach anoreksja staje się elementem, dzięki któremu rodzina funkcjonuje jako całość (np. rodzice odkładają na bok konflikt między sobą, przestają rozważać rozstanie, gdyż na pierwszy plan wysuwa się problem choroby).Gdy w 1873 roku po raz pierwszy opisano anoreksję jako oddzielną jednostkę chorobową, opracowano także pierwsze metody leczenia. Ich podstawowym elementem było oddzielenie osoby chorej od rodziny. Przez wiele lat uważano, że to rodzice są odpowiedzialni za psychiczne problemy ich dzieci. Po latach badań i dyskusji w leczeniu anoreksji coraz silniejszy staje się trend, w którym rodzina nie jest postrzegana jako przyczyna zaburzenia, ale jako najważniejszy sojusznik w walce z nim. Im młodszy pacjent, tym większe znaczenie dla jego procesu leczenia ma postawa i udział w terapii jego rodziców, rodzeństwa i innych osób blisko związanych z daną osobą.Jeżeli pierwsza faza leczenia anoreksji obejmuje pobyt w szpitalu lub specjalistycznym ośrodku, zaleca się, aby terapia rodzinna rozpoczęła się jeszcze zanim chora/chory powróci do domu. Pierwszym elementem terapii jest uświadomienie rodziców jakim zagrożeniem jest anoreksja. Zdarzają się sytuacje, w których rodzice (czasami nieświadomie) przyczyniają się do podtrzymywania choroby — np. sami chcą schudnąć i nie dostrzegają, że waga ich dziecka osiągnęła niezdrowo niski poziom lub obawiają się zaakceptowania tego, że ich dziecko jest chore w obawie przed utratą statusu “dobrych rodziców”.W czasie terapii rodzinnej bada się następujące elementy:znaczenie poszczególnych członków rodziny (hierarchia) i relacje między nimi,historia rodzinna, powtarzające się w niej schematy i zależności,charakterystyczne i powtarzające się sytuacje i zachowania związane z anoreksją,jaki wpływ na funkcjonowanie rodziny ma anoreksja.Cele terapii rodzinnej to m.in.:rozwiązanie problemu poczucia winy z powodu wystąpienia anoreksji w rodzinie,wyłączenie dzieci z konfliktów pomiędzy rodzicami,zmiana sposobu rozwiązywania konfliktów w rodzinie — poprawienie komunikacji w rodzinie (obejmuje to również rozwiązywanie ewentualnych problemów typu przemoc w rodzinie czy też nadużywanie alkoholu),uświadomienie członkom rodziny ich słabości i mocnych stron,zwiększenie swobody i elastyczności rodziny, głównie w odniesieniu do zmian związanych z dorastaniem dziecka (lub dzieci),znalezienie nowego stanu równowagi w rodzinie po wyeliminowaniu z niej zachowań anorektycznych chorego dziecka.W przypadku dorosłych osób chorych na anoreksję zalecana jest terapia małżeńska, której celem jest wzmocnienie więzi między małżonkami, rozwiązanie problemów z komunikacją oraz wyeliminowanie negatywnego wpływu zachowań podtrzymujących lub wyzwalających chorobę.

Inne formy terapii w leczeniu anoreksjiPrezentowane poniżej formy terapii nie powinny być stosowane jako podstawowa forma terapii, ale jako uzupełnienie, pomoc we właściwym procesie psychoterapeutycznym.ChoreoterapiaJest to terapia, której głównymi narzędziami są ruch i taniec (przeważnie spontaniczny, rzadziej wykorzystujący elementy tańców klasycznych). Podstawą tej metody terapeutycznej jest kulturowa rola tańca jako naturalnego sposobu wyrażania uczuć i emocji sięgająca tysiące lat wstecz. Ponieważ osoby dotknięte anoreksją mają zazwyczaj poważny problem z wyrażaniem uczuć, emocji i przeżyć, w choreoterapii taniec jest używany jako forma ekspresji. Choreoterapeuci uważają, że taniec, czyli praca z ciałem, jest równocześnie sposobem na porozumienie się z umysłem. Wykorzystując rytm do uzyskania harmonii pomiędzy ciałem, a stanem umysłu, uzyskuje się efekt integracji tych dwóch części człowieka.Wszystkie zaburzenia odżywiania, w tym anoreksja, łączy element wykorzystania przez chorą osobę jedzenia jako sposobu na odreagowanie stresu. Jednym z celów choreoterapii jest umożliwienie rozładowania tego stresu poprzez taniec — tańcząc pacjent odpręża się lub pobudza w sposób pozytywny (jako odpowiedź na przeżycie estetyczne i emocjonalne). Ponieważ zajęcia choreoterapii odbywają się w grupach, jest to również okazja do treningu komunikacji i wchodzenia w interakcje z innymi ludźmi. Uzyskany dzięki wspólnemu tańcowi efekt społecznej integracji wpływa pozytywnie na samoocenę pacjenta.Ponieważ taniec jest formą ćwiczeń fizycznych, może być wykorzystywany przez osoby dotknięte anoreksją jako próba kontroli swojej wagi, co ze względów oczywistych jest niekorzystne. Dlatego terapeuta prowadzący zajęcia choreoterapii powinien zwracać uwagę czy nie są one nadużywane w ten sposób.ArteterapiaTen rodzaj terapii polega na wykorzystaniu wszelkich form artystycznych — plastycznych, muzycznych, teatralnych. W terapii zaburzeń odżywiania najczęściej wykorzystywanymi formami są różnorodne techniki malarskie oraz tworzenie w glinie. Podobnie jak w terapii tańcem, tak tutaj tworzenie jest formą ekspresji uczuć i emocji trudnych do wyrażenia słowami lub też nierozumianych przez pacjentów. W czasie malowania czy też rzeźbienia wyzwalają się odczucia. Osoby z zaburzeniami odżywiania doświadczają emocji, z których istnienia nie zdawały sobie sprawy.Arteterapia ma przeważnie formę zajęć grupowych, podczas których terapeuta poddaje uczestnikom temat do namalowania. Tematy są tak sformułowane, aby w sposób niebezpośredni odwoływać się do skrywanych emocji lub przeżyć związanych z chorobą. Poprzez wyrażanie swoich emocji w tworzonych pracach pacjenci uczą się lepiej rozumieć swoje uczucia oraz zyskują kontrolę nad własnymi emocjami, które są wyrażane poprzez sztukę, a nie jak do tej pory zachowania anorektyczne.Terapia masażemMasaż w leczeniu anoreksji może być wykorzystany jako technika relaksacyjna. Inne działania pozytywne to oswojenie się z dotykiem innego człowieka, większa akceptacja dla własnego ciała, a także zmniejszenie niektórych dolegliwości fizycznych związanych z anoreksją (np. bóli mięśniowych i stawowych). Istnieją dwie szkoły odnośnie sposobu prowadzenia terapii masażem: po pierwsze — zachowanie ciszy w czasie masażu, aby pacjent mógł lepiej skupić się zabiegu, po drugie — w czasie masażu terapeuta prowadzi rozmowę z pacjentem, masaż pomaga rozluźnić się, dzięki czemu psychoterapia może być bardziej efektywna.Więcej na temat anoreksji przeczytasz tutaj:Biologiczne uwarunkowania anoreksjiAnorektyczna osobowośćAnorektyczna rodzinaAnoreksja w kulturzeDiagnoza anoreksjiSkutki anoreksjiAnoreksja a płodność

Now my grandpa and I are doing everything we used to do Sunday morning when I was a little kid while Grandma is making her famous breakfast We’re watching Sunday morning cartoons, the smell of coffee and good food on the griddle/in the oven, and a doggo on my lap in one of my grandpa’s flannels. I remember as a little kid, before the disorder and before there was a care in the world, falling asleep to the ticking of their clock eagerly awaiting Grandma’s home cooked breakfast anticipating all the smells. Everything was literally EXACTLY the same and it is so rare to have that these days as so many things change. The only thing that changed was me partaking in the coffee sipping 😆 In this moment I am reminded why recovery is ALWAYS the right choice. It’s the hardest fight, but always worth it.  

Recover so you can eat candy without being scared anymore

Breaking newsI hate diet culture. 

Reason #1199I want to recover because I have never felt anything more freeing than living my truth 

Me: why am I so tired all the timeMy significant other: maybe it’s because you don’t eat for daysMe: 

Okay butAm I the only one who goes through different phases of my own ideal body??? Some weeks I’m like I want to be a stîçkThen I have a “I’m gonna get healthy week” and once that’s over I’m likeI want to be a slightly chubby hour glass babie pleaseJust me???It’s the reason I keep losing all my damn progress  

when fighting an addiction you cant trust your mind. it is most likely working against you. addiction is a disease and there are millions of people just like you. you arent weak for asking for help. you can do this. recovery takes time. if it seems like youre getting nowhere, just know baby steps are better than no steps at all. dont let the distance scare you.

So I’ve gained almost 30 pounds since I started recovery and guess what. ..Nothing happened. The world didn’t collapse in on itself. My fiancé didn’t leave me. I didn’t have to drop out of college due to embarrassment. My friends didn’t stop wanting to be seen with me. And literally not ONE person has made a comment about my body changing, aside from those who knew it needed to. I’m not saying everything is better. I’m still not comfortable in my body most of the time and the ED thoughts haven’t stopped. But the world is confirming for me that those thoughts have been wrong. And they always will be, so keep going.

For everyone reading this wishing they had some form of ed let me just tell you that it isn’t a quick and easy solution, it isn’t a choice you make randomly one day. You don’t wake up and say “hmm yes I’m going to become an anorexic/bulimic”, that’s not how it works.I and like so many others suffer from this disorder. People have died.

Post zawiera drastyczne zdjęcia.W przebiegu anoreksji dochodzi nie tylko do znaczących zmian w organizmie, ale także w psychice chorej osoby. W zależności od tego ile trwa choroba, jak duży jest spadek masy ciała, pojawiają się kolejne następstwa. Istotny jest także fakt, że wyleczenie anoreksji nie powoduje odwrócenia wszystkich negatywnych efektów — część z nich to po prostu trwałe skutki głodówki.Wyniszczenie organizmuFizyczne objawy anoreksji to efekt głodówki — organizm przystosowuje się do obniżonej ilości otrzymywanych składników odżywczych i odwodnienia, uruchamiając rezerwy i zwalniając procesy metaboliczne. Podstawowe fizyczne oznaki wyniszczenia organizmu to:utrata tkanki tłuszczowej, a także zmniejszenie masy mięśniowej;obniżenie poziomu hormonów tarczycy (odpowiedzialnych m.in. za metabolizm oraz gospodarkę wapniowo-fosforanową);hipotermia (temperatura ciała utrzymująca się na poziomie poniżej 36°C),zmniejszenie częstości oddechu (oddechowe wyrównanie pH krwi, która w przebiegu anoreksji nabiera odczynu zasadowego).Zaburzenie układu krążenia i sercaProblemy związane z funkcjonowaniem serca są najczęstszą bezpośrednią przyczyną śmierci pacjentów z anoreksją. Największe zagrożenie dla serca w przebiegu anoreksji stanowi brak równowagi pomiędzy minerałami kluczowymi dla funkcjonowania układu krwionośnego: potasu, magnezu, wapnia i fosforanów. Odwodnienie i wygłodzenie organizmu powodują zachwianie równowagi pomiędzy tymi elementami. Jony wapnia i potasu są niezbędne dla prawidłowej czynności elektrycznej serca, która odpowiada za bicie serca. Inne skutki anoreksji w obszarze układu sercowo-naczyniowego:zmniejszenie masy mięśnia sercowego;zaburzenia rytmu (np. bradykardia czyli zwolnienie rytmu serca poniżej 60 uderzeń na minutę, przedwczesne skurcze przedsionkowe i komorowe);obniżone ciśnienie krwi, powodujące omdlenia i zawroty głowy;wzrost poziomu cholesterolu;zmniejszony przepływ krwi.Podstawową komplikacją anoreksji dotyczącą samej krwi jest anemia. Przewlekły niedobór witaminy B12 może powodować niedokrwistość złośliwą. W przypadkach długotrwałej anoreksji, lub niezwykle wysokiego spadku masy ciała szpik kostny ogranicza produkcję krwinek — jest to stan zagrażający życiu zwany pancytopenią.Zaburzenia układu pokarmowegona skutek niedoboru minerałów następuje osłabienie zębów i dziąseł;zaburzenia motoryki i opróżniania żołądka;bóle brzucha, wzdęcia i zaparcia (uczucie pełnego brzucha);Zaburzenia ze strony układu rozrodczegoObniżenie poziomu hormonów związanych z rozrodczością (estrogen, DHEA), w wyniku czego dochodzi do zatrzymania cyklu miesiączkowego, a z czasem także do trwałej bezpłodności. Zmianie ulegają także wielkość jajników i macicy.Zmiany dermatologicznekruchość, łamliwość, a następnie wypadanie włosów,wysuszenie i zmniejszenie elastyczności skóry,jako następstwo hipotermii ciało pokrywa się meszkiem (lanugo) podobnym do tego, który występuje w okresie płodowym.Zmiany w układzie kostnymOkoło 90% kobiet dotkniętych anoreksją dotyka osteopenia (utrata minerałów budujących kości), a 40% - osteoporoza. Ponieważ anoreksja dotyczy przede wszystkim osób w wieku dojrzewania, w tym rozwoju kośćca, osłabienie kości jest staje się efektem długofalowym, który nie znika po wyleczeniu i powrocie do normalnej masy ciała. Osłabienie szkieletu oraz obniżony poziom hormonów odpowiedzialnych za wzrost powodują, że osoby chorujące na anoreksję w okresie wzrastania odznaczają się niższym wzrostem.Problemy neurologiczneW bardzo zaawansowanych przypadkach anoreksji dochodzi do uszkodzenia nerwów oraz tkanki mózgowej. Obserwowane w przebiegu anoreksji zaburzenia neurologiczne to np.: napady padaczkowe, zaburzone myślenie, neuropatia nerwów obwodowych powodująca dziwne odczucia w stopach i dłoniach. Badania pokazują, że w przebiegu anoreksji pewne obszaru mózgu przechodzą zmiany strukturalne i wykazują nadmierną aktywność. Tylko część z tych zmian nie jest trwała — zostają cofnięte po odzyskaniu normalnej masy ciała, jednak część zmian pozostaje na całe życie. Uważa się, że zmiany te mogą być odpowiedzialne za organiczne zmiany osobowości osób z anoreksją.Zaburzenia psychikiW początkowej fazie anoreksja daje chorującemu poczucie euforii. Wraz z postępującym wyniszczeniem organizmu na skutek głodowania, chorzy doświadczają rozdrażnienia, a następnie apatii. Stan ten przechodzi w depresję. Pojawiają się myśli samobójcze i próby ich realizacji. Szacuje się, że około połowa przypadków śmiertelnych anoreksji następuje w wyniku samobójstwa.InneDługotrwała głodówka powoduje ogólne wyniszczenie organizmu, po pewnym czasie wszystkie narządy zaczynają zawodzić. Osłabiony zostaje również system immunologiczny, przez co chory jest bardziej podatny na infekcje. W przypadku anoreksji o typie bulimicznym na pierwszy plan mogą wysunąć się inne objawy — związane z prowokowaniem wymiotów oraz nadużywaniem środków przeczyszczających.Więcej informacji na temat anoreksji znajdziesz tutaj:Biologiczne uwarunkowania anoreksjiAnorektyczna osobowośćAnorektyczna rodzinaAnoreksja w kulturzeDiagnoza anoreksji

* To take pictures like these * 

you don’t have to make excuses on why you’re allowed to eat. You don’t have to go running for half an hour, or have spent the whole day on your feet. You are allowed to eat any time you want. It’s okay. Go ahead and let yourself live. 

I can’t waitI cant wait to lose 10 lbsthen 15then 20I cant wait to be my ugwi cant wait to watch as people ask me how i did iti cant wait to be skinnyso im gonna try my hardest this summerim gonna lose the weightim gonna lose weightim gonna lose the weighti willreachmyugw 

✨Ana Rules✨Y’all wanna lose some weight? Here’s how I lose weight: 1. ALWAYS EAT AT OR UNDER YOUR CALORIE LIMIT. NO EXCUSES. 2. Burn off 1000 more calories than you ate for the day. Example: if you ate 500 calories (my limit), you MUST burn AT LEAST 1,500 for the day. Work out if you must to be able to obtain this3. Allow yourself one day a week to eat like a normal fucking person. Tbh I still have a hard time with this, but I’m working on it. My “cheat” day is Saturday. I’m mostly with family and friends that day and I don’t want them to be aware of my ED, so this one day helps a lot with that. Also, keeping your metabolism on its toes helps boost it. If you must, allow two days a week for this “cheat” day. Slowly work down to one day. Note: THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BINGE. THAT WILL NOT HELP YOU PHYSCALLY OR MENTALLY. DON’T BINGE 4. Fast when you can. I typically do Fasting Fridays™️ because I’m alone all day. They do not have to be super long fasts, but skipping lunch and then eating a healthy and filling dinner will always feel like a well deserved treat compared to stuffing your face at three meals and not two. Note again: THIS IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO BINGE. HAVE SOME CONTROL AND THEN YOU’LL BE AT YOUR GW 5. EAT BREAKFAST. I cannot stress this enough. This has saved me from lunch time binges and from passing out sooooo many times. Even if it is just a banana, that is still better than nothing. Personally, I prefer oats with a dash of cinnamon to keep my hunger at bay and to give my morning metabolism a little boost6. Water. Drink it. Drink at least 2-3 bottles a day. Cold water. It helps speed shit up and everyone loves that Crip™️ feeling on an empty stomach. Also, drink a whole bottle before you go to sleep. You’ll pee a lot at night (releasing those nasty toxins) and feel better in the morning  7. S L E E P. YOU NEED THAT SHIT. There have been wayyy too many studies that say getting your 8hrs of rest will boost your metabolism, keep your energy levels up, etc. and we all know we need that a lot. Please get some beauty sleep. If you want to look delicate, you need to go to bed on time and wake up on time. It’s not that hard8. G R E E N  T E A. Need I say more? DISCLAIMER: Yeah I’ve got an ED. No I don’t support them. This is a coping thing. It’s more of a reference for me to go back to later. However, these are safe-ish ways to lose weight. The best way to lose weight though is by eating less than you burn a day, getting a good nights rest, working out, eating good healthy foods, and drinking plenty of water. Most adults should be eating around 2,000 calories per day. You should also be burning that much (if not more) per day. Please note that if you are someone with an ED, or if you know someone with one, please reach out and get help for yourself or them. Trust me, you don’t want to keep living like this. It’s so tiring. It’s painful. Please look into recovery and put some effort into it. Trust me, it’s worth it. Been there done that. It was hard but the years I spent recovered were nothing but bliss. Trauma brought me back here, but you can get out. Stay safe. GET HELP. GET OUT. STAY SAFE.  

Does anyone else get super nervous messaging their friends or really anyone online? Like I just get super nervous, afraid they won’t reply or I’ll have to get into this long conversation and if I don’t reply they’ll be mad at me. Is that only me or does anyone else feel this way? 

I hope you all have the chance to recover.I hope you all take it.💕💕💕 

I want to recover to learn self validation 

My achievements today:• Got out of bed• Ate something• Washed my face, moisturize • Brushed hairAnd that’s it. 

 

Ooooff my mood 

hey!!boys with eating disorders are valid!poc with eating disorders are valid!nonbinary people with eating disorders are valid! people in the lower class with eating disorders are valid!overweight people with eating disorders are valid!lgbt people with eating disorders are valid!i’m not saying it’s okay to have an eating disorder — i’m saying your struggles aren’t any less because you aren’t what’s shown in media. you deserve to be taken seriously if you ask for help. you deserve to recover. in nearly all real eating disorder representation, whether it’s movies, books, or shows, the one with an eating disorder is an already-thin straight white middle/upper class girl. those girls do exist, but just because the media doesn’t represent you doesn’t mean you don’t deserve help and recognition for the struggle you’re going through. you deserve to get better. you shouldn’t be afraid of not being taken seriously if you ask for help. if you think of any more feel free to add on!  

Idk about kpop thiinspo blogs- or just such blogs who also like kpop- but it breaks my heart to see my idols being looked at and worshiped for starving. I’ve seen, I’ve cried, I’ve worried over them every comeback because their jawbones are more prominent, their legs slimmer, their faces trimmer. It aches to see them lose that healthy glow and watch them tear themselves apart during practice. It aches, twists, shreds me to hear about them suffering from the same things I do. To hear how they hated how they looked- how fans made them feel like they were nothing desireable or talented because they weren’t thin. It kills me to see people posting stuff like ‘The IU diet’ ‘Sojung thiinspo thigh gap workout’ ‘Lose fast- Jimin diet’ and ‘Xiumin thiinspo!’ It’s one thing to post pictures with a meme of them or reblog gifs and moments from their recent schedules, vids, etc. but it’s another to promote their ED and follow what they did that you know was unhealthy. No self respecting fan can look at what they’ve done and wish that upon anyone else by reblogging or promoting ‘***’s fast diet’. Don’t drag our idols into this anymore than they are. It hurts seeing them in this tag. It hurts seeing fans admire how thin and sickly they’ve gotten. It hurts because I know they wouldn’t want it for us. They went through hell just to look good and they wouldn’t want the fans they care about to pick up the same unhealthy habits.  

When your hair starts growing back but it’s now an awkward length so you can’t get it to look tidy. 

whats up you beautiful people? i just watched this video called Counting Calories with a Ballerina and the stuff she says about olive oil and calorie density is something that you should all hear!! please please watch it!!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5356zt0JiDY 

Recovery is a challenge. I love a good challenge. 

ya gal’s putting herself into recovery; it’s not practical for me to lose anymore weight. my body’s getting thinner and ya, that’s great and all, but regardless of how thin i get, i’m not going to LOOK how i want. i needa go for some serious HIIT, yoga, tone my booty up, and i can’t do that shit on 800 cals a day.so, i’ll still be here and a person to talk too, but i needa focus on finding the right balance for myself. it’s stupidly hard for me to eat as many calories as i need too (even to MAINTAIN my weight, i STILL need 2100 a daY LIKE WHAT THE FFUFUUF) but yeah, i’m going to try to be all fitness ‘n shit from here on out.let’se how it goes YEHAWH 

u r valid <3 

Eating Disorder Confession #2 I get very upset anytime I actually get my period cause it means I’ve put on enough weight for it to happen  

Struggle of the day #1I sat on the bus with a morbidly obese person sitting at both sides of me and all I could think is ‘if you recover and you’ll look like them’

hello! I designed these little “recovery hearts”, inspired my the SweeTarts / Love Hearts candies, to help other people with mental illnesses. I’m personally queer, trans and mentally ill, so these are some little mantras which help me to focus my energy on the positive when it feels like everything around me is trying to tear me down.the recovery hearts are available on my redbubble as a variety of products, including phone cases, stickers and t-shirts! I think they look really cute on notebooks and they could make really good recovery journals!! there’s so much potential for these hearts, and I really hope they help at least one other person to feel a little better. please check out my shop and share this with anyone else you think might like these hearts. thank you!https://www.redbubble.com/people/araggedyangel/collections/779237-recovery-hearts

Recovery blog 30th May 2019
For those of you who have been following a while, you will rememeber my recovery blogs which I unfortunately stopped due to a relapse. However, today I’m restarting this mini series, as I plan to fully recover this time.
This morning I started off my day amazingly - I had 2 slices of toast with honey and cinnamon, and some earl grey tea. I then proceeded to watch Pretty Woman - I loved it!
For lunch I threw together some pasta and sauce, because I wasn’t up for making too much today. I finished my movie then danced in my kitchen. A lot.
For dinner, my dad brought me home a pizza, which I was unable to finish, but still ate some of.
For every meal, I ate a fear food, and I’m so proud! Hello again, recovery. 

i want to be innocent. not what society manufactures and tells us is innocent, i want true innocence, a fresh start, back to zero. i want to be new again. i want the world to be new again. i want to be curious abut the new things and be in love with the world. i want to be like nature before we put buildings and pollution all over it. i want to love the way only a dog can love.

It’s a comfort over looks/style day in the recovery realmIt’s so important to recognize the days where you need to be a little kinder, easier, and cozier with yourself. Today is one of those days 

no hope for me!1!1!1i asked my mom again to get me therapy because i had one of the worst mental breakdowns yesterday because my mom forced me to eat a lot of rice and a couple tiny pieces of chicken even after i ate under my limit since i just wasn’t hungry, literally my appetite has been so suppressed it’s weird, and i screamed at her and cried myself to sleep 🙃i have tried to get help, ive asked my mom before for therapy/counseling some form of help constantly and shes just like “sToP aCtInG sIcK! tHiNk pOsITiVe God WiLl hEaL yOu!1!1!1 jUsT pRaY!1!1!” and that can only work for so long, i feel terrible for doubting my faith but….i give up, guess imma keep going then 🙃 

her body is fucking goals ✨ 

Low cal sweet and sour sauce*Requested*+-½ cup powdred sweetenerl½ cup rice vinegar4 tablespoons reduced-sugar ketchup1 tablespoon soy sauce1 teaspoon garlic powderPut all the ingredients except the sweetener in a pot and whisk while it boils. Now add some sweetener until its sweet enouth for you.It’s not really the sauce like fast food places (obviously) It’s a little bit more asian and goes well with chicken  

I want to recover because I’m finally getting back parts of me that I never meant to give away

Recovering even when it feels like it makes you less desirable to your partner(s) or just those around you is so hard and for everyone going through that specific situation in their recovery I just want you to know that I’m so so proud of you for putting your recovery first. You’re gorgeous. You’re desirable. You’re strong as hell.

You do not need to overwork yourself to meet others standards! You are good enough as you are! It’s ok if all you can do somedays is get out of bed, as long as you’re trying.

if you’re new to this, RUN. i can’t stress this enough. i know you hear it all the time, but you need to get out.if you’re looking at those people getting out of control and thinking you won’t be like them, you’re wrong. if you stay here, you’ll join them.when i first started restricting, i was 180 and my ugw was 160. when i reached 160 it became 150. i’m now 140 and my ugw is 115. i know i’m not in control.this is your fate. you will end up like this, lowering your goal farther and farther, getting excited over half a pound lost, kneeling on the kitchen floor crying because you ate 50 calories more than your goal.there’s no way to get an ed and not go down this route. you aren’t going to just eat less and then stop when you’re at your goal. get out before it’s too late for you. delete this app and get away.  

27 hours into my fast, -0,6 kg gone. I reached my first goal weight, this weekend is treating me good so far. Might break my fast in 7 hours or so, it depends on how I will feel. I can’t afford to be dizzy or weak, I got stuff to do 💘 

a thing about this community is that everyone just goes into your head and makes you believe that they care about you and that they help you become happyBULLSHITspoiler: being skinny doesnt make you happyanother spoiler: people who encourage your disordered behaviour do not care for you 

Please read this.Hey, I just wanted to let all of you know that I care about you. I really do. I know what you’re going through and I know how tough it can be. I know what it’s like to look in the mirror and hate yourself. I know what it’s like to pinch every inch of fat on your body, even if it doesn’t really exist. Sometimes you know you’re dealing with a disorder and other times you can’t accept it no matter how deep down you dig. I understand what it’s like to step on and off the scale 30 times because you can’t accept how much you weigh. You are not alone. I promise you. I don’t have notifications on but my dms are always open and I am always happy to help any way possible. Remember that someone out there truly loves you.  

thigh gap inspo 🥀 stay safe. 

My phones telling me to get off my ass and work out and drink water but my brains telling me to make nachos and watch Netflix.  

I‘M SO HUNGRY WTHI‘ve been running on less than 300cals a day for the past week but it my hunger feels worse than usual and I don‘t know why, I just had like 5 cups of almond milk bc I don‘t have anything else in my fridge and I can‘t get groceries till friday…..throwing away all of my food wasn‘t a good idea lmao I would sell my soul for some porridge rn :)))  

🖤✖️🖤 

Do you ever look back at your life, furious about how much mental illnesses have ruined for you? For example my depression made me fatigued constantly, making me miss out on opportunities I might have had. My anxiety made me over-analyse every word anyone ever said to me and leave me with huge trust issues. My eating disorder made me avoid lunch in school between the ages of 13 and 17 because I was terrified of eating in front of other people. I hated eating in front of my family and I spent each day lethargic, lacking both motivation and the energy to do my schoolwork. I messed up my grades and my prospects in life and for what?! What did I get in return for restricting my food intake and doing cardio until I passed out after my parents went to sleep?! I’ll tell you what. I got defensive about my eating habits to people who wanted the best for me, I got lackluster grades and didn’t get accepted to the study program I wanted, I lost friends because they asked too many questions and I was left lonely, and sad, and never as skinny as I wanted to be because my goals were unrealistic!!To anyone who looks at eating disorders, or depression, or anxiety or any mental illness and see beauty and salvation; run away. I cannot stress this enough. You deserve better, and even if you don’t think that anyone loves you now, someday someone will. You don’t want to be almost 20 years old and already feel like you have failed at life due to your own bad choices. This is no way to live. 

It makes me sad when I see reblogged posts from deactivated ed blogs as there’s a chance that they could’ve died.However on the flip side, they could very well be in recovery and that makes me a lot happier.  

dirty mirror, I already seen it  

Ok so yesterday I binged…pretty bad… wish I would look like this without sucking in but with my superduper awesome self-control that’s far away…
 

It’s kind of amazing how the less you eat the less food your stomach can take. I remember when I could binge eat a whole bunch of food like it was nothing, now I can barley eat a serving of lasagna without feeling like my stomach is going to explode. 

I feel like I’m not giving myself enough credit. Even on the really hard days, I have refrained from behaviors for a while now. And it is hard. But I’m getting through this one day at a time. I’m getting better. 

 

If he calls you fat call him single 

PSAIf you’re doing the thing(s) you “love” in order to fulfill some expectation(s) set by others or because others’ compliments you receive for certain aspects about said thing(s) you “love” are driving you into the ground then maybe you don’t love it at all? Or maybe you do, but it’s causing extremely toxic scenarios, thoughts, lifestyles, and affecting your relationships. That’s when you need to step back and reevaluate what you WANT. Not what you believe you “need” to do in order to fill these made up perceptions of you and your thing(s). That goes for hobbies, your major in college, your job, etc. There’s a HUGE difference between having passion for something versus feeling like you need to do something  

 I am in no way promoting any type of ED and I wish recovery to you all sometime soon❤I hate the fact that this blog is actually “motivating” some of you to keep doing what you’re doing. (Unhealthy habits) &  some of you guys message me saying my blog motivated you. I am not pro Ana.   

Stop dreaming about the body you want AND DO SOMETHING TO HAVE IT 

I feel so guilty and bad for having an ED. All I can think about are the kids in developing countries who are starving but not by choice. They would do anything to have access to the amount of food I do and I’m just wasting it and all because i for some reason have this need to be thinner. I feel like a shit person and don’t know what to do 

Recently, a girl I knew died of anorexia.Until now, the concept of death never seemed very real to me. I understood death took someone, they weren’t on Earth anymore, their heart had stopped- but that was about as far as my knowledge went. I never knew anyone who had died except my great-grandmother, but I never spent much time with her.I’m thinking about this girl. She was smiling, breathing, talking, being one moment.  Now, her cold body is buried in a graveyard, hidden among others. The thought that that could be me terrifies me. Pale and forgotten, just another tally on the infinite scoreboard of death. With all my insecurities and fears and hidden secrets, do I really want to die? Am I really in need of losing even more weight on my body? And you, on yours? You look how you’re supposed to- beautiful. And I know you might not believe it. You might look in the mirror and see fat, stretch marks, cellulite, and that’s all. But I see, your family sees, your friends see a beautiful human being worthy of love and appreciation. They don’t measure your worth by the measure of your waist, how thin your thighs are, or if you have a slight double chin or not. They love you for you.You are perfect.Please, eat. Even if it’s one or two meals a day, that’s better than zero. Even if you decide to rule out meat products, that’s better than starvation. If you never drink sodas or sweet drinks, that’s fine too. I really only drink water. But please, I beg you to take care of yourself. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and even if you, the current beholder, don’t think so, someone else thinks you are the most lovely person. (Which you are).Of course, everyone’s elf-image is distorted. Anxieties and made-up worries plague minds no matter how little truth there is to them. Mental illnesses you did nothing to trigger plant seeds of doubt, watered by fear and depression. Photoshopped men and women stare out from the covers of magazines, glossy and god-like, forcing you to look down upon your own body, judgmental. Twisting any self-confidence into self-hatred. I promise you, there is nothing to hate about yourself.I’m not deleting this blog because I’m not sure if this post will go away with it. But this will be the last post on this blog, I promise you. I know I don’t have many followers, but if this can reach even one person I will feel accomplished. I can go about the rest of my life knowing I helped someone. Reblog this. Send this to someone you know who is suffering. And if that person is you, look in the mirror. Think of the person who makes you the happiest, and smile. No matter what you think, when anyone smiles, they look beautiful. You don’t need to starve yourself. You don’t need to binge and purge. You don’t need to count every calorie. All you need to do is find ways to love yourself.Because you are worth so much more than what a stupid scale says. 

Took a shower today yayyy! 

TW: Suicide, Suicidal IdeationHey so I’m seeing that post circulate where it says something along the lines of ‘If I killed myself the stars would still come out. The seasons would still change and the world would keep spinning. So why not?’. Let me be real with you- when I was in my earlier teens and just beginning to come to terms with my depression I still couldn’t voice my feelings in a non-harmful way. To make a long story short- fifteen year old me would have reblogged that or posted it somewhere or whatever. And believed it. Now, nineteen year old me, the suicide survivor of someone I literally would have never thought I’d see myself getting a better relationship with at age fifteen- I hate that goddamn post and I agree with that edit someone made a long ass time ago where it goes into a convoluted story of how everyone you knew is never gonna be the same. Because it’s fucking true.  I don’t give a shit if the stars will still come out at night because it’s not like I can even go on the patio to enjoy them anymore. I don’t give a shit if the world still turns because as far as I’m concerned- this world just reminds me every single day the reasons why you did what you did.   I don’t give a shit if the seasons change because Halloween wasn’t the same without you and I don’t even want to think about how Thanksgiving or Christmas or any other holiday. I don’t give a shit about any of that because some days I can get by but all it takes is one little reminder and the stars all but disappear, the world stops turning, and the seasons die. So let this serve as a reality check for suicidal individuals that you deserve help and you deserve to get better and although I never understood the whole leaving someone behind thing as a kid- I understand now. As someone who was left behind. And it hurts every day. Get help for yourself but also never assume that nobody will care if you just disappear one day. I never got to tell my sister I loved her one last time. So that’s another reminder to say those words as often as you can as well.  

Take ur vitamins and stay healthy !!! 💪💪💪

honestly y’all, wholly and truly dedicating yourself to your recovery is the best decision you could ever make and don’t let your ed tell you otherwise. im so much healthier and happier now than i ever was with an ed 

I’m at the bookstore and these ladies said “…counting calories.” And I swear to god my ears zoomed in. Like I just froze and stared to listen to what they were saying like an insane person just to see what they were talking about. Zero self control.  

yall always talk about how skinny=happy (which is a fat lie but ill let yall slide) but imagine how fucking euphoric it must be after all this time to chug an entire bottle of soda and a tub of ice cream and a pizza and feel 0 guilt, like you needed and deserved it!!!! yall pressure yourselves too much in the process of the eating disorder and end up unhappy at the end no matter your weight. work on your mental state and how you feel about yourself because once you learn to accept yourself, it stays forever and your ed satisfaction varies with your weight and is temporary/nonexistent.

It’s ok to be angry! Scream into the forest and write angry poetry. Wear black clothes and dark makeup. Expressing your emotions is a normal thing to do! 

I want to recover to accept what I cannot change and have the courage to change what I can

what vegetables (or other, i don’t mind) do you find you get the most out of for low calories? i tend to live in boiled broccoli but it’s kinda boring now haha 

I feel like my blog has been so dead since I announced my recovery. I really miss you all. Please let me know if you still want me to keep my account alive. 

My problem is I don’t wanna eat, but when I do I hate myself  

Dropped two sizesI fit into an xs today at the store, as well as a size 2 in jeans, which were also slightly big. just two weeks ago i was two sizes larger. I don’t feel small enough for that size, but apparently I am. seeing that size gave me so much motivation to push further. 

yknow when you suck in your stomach and you’re not looking but you can just Feel your ribs poking out more? that’s the shit right there 

i cannot tell you to fix yourself or to stop whatever kind of self-destruction you’re doing, that would make me a hypocrite and if i can’t practice what i preach then that’s just not fair, but please don’t push yourself too far.  if you’re getting really light headed from malnutrition, at least eat a couple of snacks, something that can sustain you.  it’s not fair to let your body completely break down just in order to fit what you feel is the beauty standard, and i wish the pressure to lose weight was never reinstated in people, it fuckimg sucks.  im saying this because somebody dm’d me and told me to delete this account because it “glorifies mental illness and eating disorders” and it absolutely does not.  i do not try to make eating disorders seem cute or whatever the fuck, they’re painful, physically and mentally.  sometimes i can’t move because my stomach hurts so much from binging or from laxatives or from gastritis because i have been so destructive to my body, nothing about that is pretty.  i’d say that 80% of people with accounts like mine have them because it’s a release that they can’t have irl, it’s hard to talk about eating disorders with people who don’t understand, and on this website we can all understand each other.  but i understand that some things i post can be triggering and if you see something of mine that makes your eating disorder worse, please block me, i wont be offended.  i love all of you and hope that you’re able to be healthy and happy.  i know you can do it. 

Trynna get my quad game as strong as @championsaremade 😆🤩💪🏼 

When a friend comments she/he lost weight out of nowhereOriginally posted by heckyeahreactiongifs 

I am not proEDHaving an eating disorder isn’t beautiful. It’s not easy, it fucking sucks. I dont think tumblr realises that with or without thinspo we STILL have a fear of food?? Seeing these things help me to calm down. Looking at ED memes make me laugh for once in my day and without that…. Tumblr may or may not try and take down our blogs but this was NEVER me promoting the eating disorder I have. This was always me finding comfort in a community where others know what it’s like to not eat like i do. I have never posted th/inspo with the intent of making people feel bad about their own bodies. Because that happens regardless and it sucks. I have posted it as an outlet to myself and maybe for others. Because on this site we dont have to hide as much anymore.   

I made a decision. Hello fellows. Let’s get to the point because i have much to say about this topic. I don’t want to be anna or be obcessed with my weight anymore. Do you know why ? Because i’ve been hurting my real friends, my family , they notice that i’m turning into a depressed skeleton. If i keep with this mentality i’ll die in a couple of days. I don’t want to hurt people who love me even more. I don’t want to be selfish. What’s the point to be so skinny as a skeleton ? I wouldn’t make anyone proud , i can’t give up on my academical formation as a person for achieve a stupid goal weight that possible might kill me. Any of you guys know how much cost a treatment if you got hospitalized for collapse without nutrients?? Above 200 euros (in portugal) . I don’t want that for my family that treatment is so fucking expensive.. The money is important to pay my bills for the house and my college, to buy some books, to buy clothes, makeup wtv, not to be hospitalized in the verge of death.. I don’t want to be a living death person anymore. I almost feel that i’ve no soul anymore. I’m avoidying everyone in my real life. I feel so lonely.. I choose to live. I have so many things to give in this life ! Enough of this ridiculous life. Enough to worry everyone. I want to fight for my future life . It’s stupid fight for being death !! Think about that all the anorexic/suicidal girls. Learn to enjoy life. Don’t let the voices in your head and all the ppl who hurt you be victorious. You have to fight you have to live you all deserve to be happy . I’ll start my recovery. I’m tired to be in pain for eight years of anorexic and bulimic life. Im seeking for help , i want to become a normal girl again fullfiled with energie and knowlege. Goodbye anna, goodbye bulimia. Fuck you  .l. .l. .l. i’m stronger than you! 

Yall powerade zero is the shit okay its 0cals it tastes sweet so it takes away my cravings and it makes me feel full I highly recommend it<3 Stay safe

I made some cute wallpapers for myself and decided to share them 

so i had a very good birthday! i also actually ate a cupcake and like frosting and like… didn’t care. i had a really good day in general i feel real good 

So, what I have begun to realize is that your body dysmorphia is going to increasingly get worse if you don’t recover. here’s why…. you hate they way you look. you see a distorted image of yourself… but for example if you already are a healthy weight THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING YOU CAN DO BUT ACCEPT YOUR BODY AND EAT HEALTHIER. It’s the cold hard truth. If you don’t work on recovery you will keep losing and losing and losing until you are dead. DEAD. SO PLEASE STOP LOOKING AT THINSPO right now. Throw that stupid shit away. Focus on recovery. Obviously that’s easier said then done but I wish the best for you. As always sending y’all lots of love, Ava.   

Hey just a reminder that you are loved and wanted. That’s all. Have a nice night ❤ 

Body check, 5’9”, 117.6. I still look fat, but only 18 more pounds to lose. I can do this :)) 

Me: you know, I think today I’ll eat something! Ana: like water?Me: no, like actual food Ana: ohhhh ok so ice cubes? Me: Ana: Me: Ana: or maybe gum? Mints? Green tea? Black coffee? C’mon you got so many options here  

I don’t need to prove to people that i’m in pain. They know i’m struggling; i don’t have to show them with my body. I can take care of myself and still be hurting. I don’t have to hurt myself to solidify my negative feelings.  

so I told my mom that I wanted ice cream earlier (especially since I had already eaten very little today so I was super hungry). she then went to the store and bought ice cream. I told her not to (because it’s a fear food) but she did anyway.after crying a bunch, I ate the whole little cup. granted it had a bunch of calories and it really freaked me out, I managed to make it through. I’m trying not to let the guilt sink in too much, especially since its almost 1am and I have no idea what we’re eating tomorrow but oh well. I’ll live, right? Haha well that was my little recovery win: eating Strawberry Shortcake ice cream from blue bunny 💛😊 

I!!! Suppressed!!! A binge!!!! Today!!!! Granted, what I wanted was Cheerios (not that bad, comparatively speaking) but I was able to buy them and STILL stop myself! They’re in my cupboard and I’ll have them tomorrow for breakfast!!!! Guys!!!! I DID THAT  

Positive Message of the DayReaching out for help does NOT mean you’re weak. I know we live in a culture of being independent and self-reliant, and we’re often told to be ashamed of ourselves for needing support. It’s okay! Knowing when you need help and support is a brave, strong thing to do, so don’t be afraid! 

If you’re in this community all I want to say is that I’m sorry and I truly hope you find the recovery you deserve 

 

“Be still. Feel the beating of your heart. The rise and falling of your chest. The subtle heat that radiates from your skin. You are alive. And everything that you; your skin, your eyes, as well as your talents and traits, is something to cherish. So take this life that you have, and live it.” 

god, i wanna be skinny SO fucking bad

Dragonfruit and chia seed oatmeal 😋 Of course you can barely see it under all the toppings (which is how oatmeal should always be eaten). 
Summer started and I’ve been spending the first week at my parents house, it’s been soooo nice to finally wind down and relax. I’ve been able to read for fun instead of for classes again, and started Wind, Sand, and Stars by Saint-Exupéry, and it’s amazing so far ✨ 

I never rlly thought I’d be an adult crying about cheese yet here I am 

When I gain weight I feel like such a failure. Even if it’s just 0.1 lbs it makes me wanna give up completely. It’s ridiculous and I feel so stupid for feeling this way, but when I gain weight, not only have I failed myself, I’ve also failed ana 



me:
                                                whenever i've hurt someone, i feel the urge to cut. i'm doing great when it comes to suppressing the urge to self harm... but when the guilt kicks in, i can barely help it.                    

therapist:
                                                just think about it. you've been taught that making mistakes brings awful consequences for many years. whenever your abusers were upset with you, it meant you had to suffer in order to be forgiven eventually. and now that you're out of there, you're still dealing with what you've learned - you will be forgiven once you've suffered, and that's why you want to hurt yourself. but you can learn to forgive yourself. let yourself know that what happened wasn't good, but you can do better next time. do what your parents did not do.                    



Does anyone else get this?It sounds weird but after I eat like a meal™ I can smell food on my hands and body. I know I’m oddly sensitive to smell but this doesn’t seem to make sense, it’s always the same smell and it’s all I can sense from my body. Yesterday I ate a meal and all I can think about is how everyone can tell that I ate because I smell like food. It’s just really stressing me out and it feels unfair :/ 

Yellow {not mine} 

Pro ana tip!(Before I start off, I would like to inform all who read this, including the ones who managed to get my old account terminated, that I DO NOT endorse any eating disorders, and I do encourage everyone to recover. I simply use this as an outlet for me, and encouraging myself and others to at least eat. Thank you, now on with the post.)Do you often get tired of the flaky, soupy consistency of oatmeal, as well as it being unwilling at times?No problem!Simply microwave it (I do it for 40 seconds, it really depends) until it starts bubbling up. Now you have a nice, thick, filling bowl of oatmeal!  Best brand of oatmeal to use? Oatfit.At just 100 calories per packet (very filling, let me tell you) you can enjoy yourself without having to dig into your weekly savings for your calorie budget!As far as now, I’ve only tried their Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal, but there may be others! I sincerely recommend this to any Ana, great for a sweet tooth!  Stay safe, loves! 🌼 

Its July and I am alreay terrified of december like family meals and chocolate everywhere and cookies and the christmas party at work I just want to be skinny and I am scared to not have the discipline to deny all that food ugh 

Ana: it’s just 5 pounds why is that so hard for you to do!?Me: damn bitch!!! you’re not wrong but damn!!!!

my friends are so thin it makes me sad :( 

finally not 200 anymore!! :) progress 💘 

I’m doing a 3-day water fast starting tomorrow to heal my body’s immune system and stop any binges from happening when I start the Fix It Fast Diet on Saturday. I find it so much easier to fast then to restrict so I will have to exercise a lot of control this next few weeks. 

How did you lose weight so fast?Originally posted by freshprincesubs 

i can’t wait for the day that i sit down and my stomach doesn’t roll out of control like it always does.  

 

A concept we should all understand but don’t apparently: The doctor who gave you medicine after just one appointment? With no proper examinations or other required procedures? Just gave you pills after hearing you describe basic symptoms of a disorder? And again, after a single appointment? He’s not helping you, he’s scamming you and putting your life and health at risk. Don’t support doctors like that. That isn’t how it’s done. You could get a serious addiction or develop severe health issues if your doctor doesn’t do his job properly, so know how to recognize that he isn’t and try your best to find a better one if that’s the case. 

“Is it bad that I promote recovery and would never wish an eating disorder on my worst enemy, but I kind of don’t want to recover myself; instead I want to look so unwell that people start to worry?” - Me 



My eating disorder thoughts are hitting me hard today 😢
I’ve gained some weight in recovery and it’s killing me.
I want to be happy and not care about physical beauty but it just idk is always on my mind. 
Im still guna fight the thoughts in my head, but damn is it hard and damn does it make me hella sad and anxious many days 😓 

i look prettier when i’m starving.  

I hate it when people tell me I don’t have any weight to lose because I know it’s all a lie 

What day is this?So, yeah. My eating disorder is fighting to come back into controll, but I am also fighting to be normal again. Personally, I don’t believe I’ll ever make a full recovery, but I know that I will be pretty damn close to it. Each day I want to starve myself but I still eat my once fear foods, have that little bit of chocolate to piss my ed off and sometimes enjoy my whole 90Kcal hot chocolate instead of my normal 45Kcal one.As long as I keep taking little steps, try and not log calories, everything will be fine. (I’ve been getting back into that for some reason?)No matter what I will fight for my freedom to have what I want to eat, and to enjoy it. One of these days I’ll have to bake a cake (chocolate maybe?) for myself, it’s one of my greatest fear foods and if I can overcome that I can over come anything.

Post Workout body check because feeling kinda cute for once 😅 

LookI have a little less than 4 months until school starts. I have 4 months to change, to restrict, fast, lose weight so that when school starts, i will be going into my senior year dainty and pretty.  

YO THANKS FOR 300 FOLLOWERSthat’s lovely, but god, please seek help!!! you deserve to thrive ❤(anons always open) 

Hey, Ana, leave them kids alone!!! 

body goals 

Ya girl keeps binging and binging Kms  

You.are.valid•even if you eat over 1000cals(the average person needs an upwards of 2000, anything lower than that is restriction)•even if you aren’t underweight•even if you’ve never fasted for more than 24 hours•even if you are a boy•even if you are a poc•even if you’ve gained weight since you’ve had your disorderEating disorders don’t give a fuck about weight, gender, age, etc. Eating disorders are a mental disorder that effect everyone of all backgrounds. Never let you, or anyone else think otherwise. 

Just saying, i promote NOTHINGI wouldn’t ever want anyone to go through what I’m going through. I am pro recovery. I am trying. I am still not ready to recover , but I will. Please seek recovery, seek for help. Take care. I love you. 

I’m gonna say this incase it just happens to helps someoneSo one of my friends sat in my lap today and said “I feel like I’m crushing Levi.” And then laughed and got up to sit next to me instead. But I got sad because honestly? Squishy people are the best people to have in your lap. My friebd isnt fat, she’s a healthy weight, but she isn’t skinny either. And she’s just so squishy and great and I loved having her on my lap because of how soft she was.  

Here we go again I feel like I’m slipping up. I don’t really feel like eating, my body checking has become more frequent, I wanna weigh myself constantly. I wanna stay on track but I’m just so scared I’ll fall back into old practices, how pathetic would that be. Not even discharged for a full month before they ship me back in.  

Never judge someone’s eating disorder by the way they look.

89lbs 

it doesnt help me as much as male thinspo does but i realised that scrolling through some online stores (f.ex. alienmood) is surprisingly good thinspo. and if you scroll trough it in public no one will question it cause youre just looking at the clothes right 

Celebrating Friday by making a giant raspberry salad! It was delicious, but I struggled a bit with the size of it 😅 I still tend to fill up very fast when eating, and while I usually make myself eat the entire meal to combat any anorexia habits, I don’t always manage to finish. 
Regardless, the salad was a huge hit and I’ll be making it again for sure ✨  

Soooo good😍✨

Recipe number 2 from Shalane Flanagan’s Run Fast Eat Slow cook book 🥣 🥕 
Air fried some chicken for some protein as well👌🏼🍗  

LOW CAL alternatives to ice cream - Starbucks Frappuccino made with almond milk and no whip (and sugar free syrup if they have it in the desired flavor). Freeze it for a few extra minutes at home, and you can eat it with a spoon! A tall could come out to be 110-150lkcal, and a grande would be around 210-250kcal. This is less than MOST low-cal ice cream pints (and better, in my opinion. I only like, like…3 halo top/arctic zero flavors)- Smoothies! They’re so diverse, and you can put things like cocoa powder, bananas, vanilla protein powder, and PB2 in them to simulate ice cream flavors! Maybe even sprinkle coconut crisps or nuts on top. This is a lot of nutrients your body needs!!- Açaí bowls with and low sugar granola and fruits, sprinkled with a mix of PB2, cocoa powder, and your favorite sugar free sweetener! Even sugar free syrup/honey works! Amazingly good! Nutrients!!! So yummy and colorful! Indulge in your sweet tooth in a smart way to prevent binging, stay relatively low cal, and get precious nutrients. These can even be eaten as meals! Though I’d suggest supplementing your frappy freeze with some extra fruit or veggies. Stay safe, sweet babies!  

Tfw you look down and see your fat tummy despite restricting all day… 

👏 Small 👏 Improvements 👏 Are 👏 Good 👏Improvements! 👏Hello friends, Miku here!My mod/producer struggles with self-care and the typical suggestions they get for improving their mental health. If you can’t eat healthy meals all the time, but manage to eat two or three meals a day (especially if you’re autistic or have ADHD and forget to eat regularly), that is an improvement!If you can’t manage to take showers as much as you need to, but you do manage to shower once a week, even if it’s at 1:00 am? That’s better than not showering at all!If you can’t manage to get a sleep schedule together, but you manage to do one thing that helps with sleep hygiene, that’s an improvement!Small improvements are just as important as large improvements, and don’t let people say you’re not trying hard enough if you can’t manage to do all of the steps at once!

About RecoveryHey! I’m putting myself into recovery. I’ve been eating 800 calories daily this last week and my mood as increased, my love has increased, and my mindset has shifted. I can’t stand idly by and kill myself anymore. I knew I had it in me!! I’m hopeful. Please keep reading if you’re considering recovery./Here’s my story, quickly. I was depressed for all of high school. I missed my prom, I missed all my grades inside jokes, I missed friends and parties and everything. In mid 2018 I started restricting. I think July? I’ve lost a lot of weight. I lived for the next time I’d see people and they’d say hey you look great! But now I dread it. Aren’t I worth more than my weight? Why is the first thing you always say related to my appearance? I started to hate myself more than I ever did with a BMI of 32.2./Let’s not bullshit. Confidence comes with weight loss. But confidence DOES NOT equal self love. I’m gonna repeat that. /Confidence =/= Self Love/People’s priorities and needs are never the same from one’s recovery to the next. A lot of recovery posts say, hey, you deserve to eat! I personally never had the mentality that I didn’t deserve to eat. I’ve never used meanspo and I’ve never encouraged anyone else to be anorexic. My priorities were different. I starved myself because I hated myself, and I figured if I looked a certain way I wouldn’t hate myself anymore. Here’s the scoop, scoob:/Even if I liked the way I looked, I would still hate myself./And literally I don’t have the energy to like ANYTHING right now. Even with 800 calories daily I’m so gone mentally. Let’s say, theoretically, there was a correlation relationship between weight and self-love. My brain would deadass be so gone from lack of nutrition that I wouldn’t even be able to register the idea that I love myself. Please, consider that. Your brain is not working. You are not capable./I’m deleting my blog tomorrow. I want to rip the rug out from under my feet. Please, please consider recovery today. It can be scratchy and rough. It can be upping your intake to 600-2000cal daily. Who cares, it’s yours, and you can increment it however you need to./I hope you grab your love from within you and wear it on your sleeve. I hope you walk to enjoy the view instead of the effect on your body. More than anything, I hope you have the strength to say you’re more than your eating disorder. You aren’t your calories or the lies you’ve told or the food you’ve binged. You’re you, and there’s nothing more individually beautiful than the self./I want to thank @royalveinspaperplanes. Your posts and words influence me greatly. You’re amazing for all you do in the community. You’ve genuinely helped me and I hope you find your way back to recovery. Don’t be afraid to take care of yourself❤❤❤ 

Fuck yeahSo I’ve had probably around 430 calories so far and I started to get hungry again around twelve. My first thought was a taco. But immediately after that I thought “tea”.Im going to lose this weight. I’ve never been happy with my body. Ive always been shamed for it, mostly by family. I will lose this weight. Three years ago I found out how, and I swear and promise to myself that it will not take me another three years to get to my goal.  

Where I’m at these days. No counting, no weighing, and no dancing—and I think it needs to stay that way for a while. Thanks for the encouragement on my last text post ❤️❤️❤️ 

I’m in love with these protein fluffs now (and don’t worry I also had something else for breakfast additionally)🙈

 

Bone broth for ED’s So I wanted to share something that I really think will help some of you be a little healthier. So bone broth is 30 calories a cup but packed with nutrients and minerals that your body needs. It also helps with healing your stomach lining and intestines. Try to get this in you every single day. It’s a very bland flavour but has such big health benefits and barely any calories. Please if you are recovering or struggling add this to your diet. It will give you a lot of the nutrients your diets lack and is still a “safe” food for most.  

Body check - really wish I had a scale but I am gonna weight myself soon when I go to the doctor. 





Showing my face, yeyy🙈 
this is my favorite dog of all time, he’s sadly not mine🙈 

What do you think about vegan keto diet?the keto is… irrational for me… FaT? FaTtY fOoDs???! LOOLtell me your thoughts on this…Originally posted by freshcravings 

29/05/19 update #1I’m getting to my GW and I’m super excited about it. I hope everything will continue to go fine and I won’t gain. I’m a little bit nervous, because my dad is coming home from work tommorow (he works abroad for a few weeks and then comes back for one or two) and I’m scared he’ll pressure me to eat more or will make comments about my eating or weight. I can only hope everything will be good. I’ll maybe just hide my body in bigger clothing and hopefully he or anyone else won’t notice my weight loss. Wish me luck.  

Eating Disorder Confession #3I became vegetarian just so I could limit more of what I eat and means people won’t ask questions when I don’t eat certain things 

Results of my anorexia kicking my ass for a while…  

me, logging onto tumblr.com after 2 weeks to announce that i gained 5lb: 

So so tired. 

My first dinner in this beautiful coconut bowl was mashed broccoli with seeds, nuts and two good sauces🥦🥥 

Reminders for me- it takes a while to lose weight even when youre restricting - especially when youre just starting out again- its not gonna be visible for a few weeks- the LOSS IS NOT GOING TO BE VISIBLE FOR A FEW WEEKS- water weight exists,- youre on your period and youre bloated . fucking calm down oh my god - 1200 calories is a difficult diet and youre doing much less than that. no matter what youre gonna lose weight- it cant happen instantly no matter how fuckin much you want it to  

body check because i actually feel skinny for once???? my bf gave me his hoodie and im like swimming in it oh my god i love it 

Things they don’t tell you about ana #4Like any serious mental illness, it messes with your memory. I can’t remember almost anything from the past 5 years because of this disorder. All I know is I’ve been miserable obsessing over my weight

I failed today.4 days binge free.Tomorrow I will do better. ♥️ stay safe ♥️ 

Recovery Plan I will start by forcing myself to have a net cal intaje of 700 calories a day, which is terrifying. Once 700 is no longer scary and I am comfortable, I will move up to 800 and then continue adjusting to higher calories until Im at 1200 a day. I will not weigh myself at all. I will continue to exercise, but the more I exercise, the more I have to eat. This is terrifying but I know it will be worth it. Also, @daydreamingofdusk really inspired me to recover. Their blog just radiates comfort and reassurance. I reccomend anyone thinking about recovery to take a look and remember whats good for them. Im so happy to be taking steps in a new direction, away from my eating disorder. I know I can do this.  

Breakfast.. Feeling guilty now. But I’m gonna keep fighting :) 
 

I think people forget that if you want to lose weight to make somebody else (crush/boyfriend/girlfriend/parent/etc.) happy that’s okay. At the end of the day, it’s what keeps YOU motivated. 

When your ED tells you you shouldn’t eat something.Originally posted by wishinguponwashedupstars 

I can feel the relapse coming. Help.  





A few more casual ana phone wallpapers for those who asked.  



Tea time😌💕 

If you are recovering or want to recover from an ED, please read this.I’ve seen a lot of people on here who were in their recovery journey, and they ended up developing another eating disorder instead of truely recovering. Please do try and recover. Don’t let this scare you, but don’t forget to consult with a dietician or someone who was successful in their recovery journey or a coach or whatever… Just don’t go into it alone.First thing you need is support. If not from friends and family then from an online following. I know many anas who aren’t in recovery who would cheer you on if you are, myself included. We don’t want you to suffer, we only want to understand eachother and minimise the damage. Please do get help if you can. We want eachother to recover and be safe and happy.Second thing is order. To fight a disorder, you need order. Obviously. You need to regulate your diet. Best way to do this is to get a doctor involved. If you can’t, then someone with experience. Since you already have an ED you are prone to getting another one, it’s just how it is. So you have to prevent that from happening. It’s really easy to develop a BED while you are in recovery, or become obsessed with fitness etc… If you are still looking to lose weight while you are in recovery (because you are overweight and are afraid it would cause complications etc) please try to do so in a healthy way. If you are looking to gain it (because you are underweight) try to not do so by binging it back up, and so on. Best way to do so is by having a professional monitor your eating habits to prevent irregularities.Third thing is you need to prevent relapses. Surround yourself with positivity. Don’t let the voices tell you how you look. Listen to compliments, talk to someone about your worries. Recognise the signs of a relapse and stop it right where it is. It will not control you anymore. You are the one who controls it. Focus on your own happiness and not the ED’s happiness.And now with that in mind, good luck on your journey. 

If you are in a place where you feel you have to lie about your ED because of an already mental health denying or otherwise abusive household, please explain your situation to a counselor or trusted teacher. If you are lying about your ED because you know your parent/guardian/etc will immediately want to provide you with whatever care is necessary, STOP LYING. Today. Get help.Some of us are well into adulthood where no other adult is going to have the sympathy to try and care for us in a way a parent will provide for their young child. And we’re over here drowning in the bullshit and trying to be adults at the same time and it sucks. Get help while you still have a support system above you. Please. 

I want to recover from everything and love myself and this world 

How my day is going…I skipped 2nd block to get high in the bathroom because weed is one of the only things that makes me feel better. I feel really lightheaded but I’m planning on staying under 100 calories today.  

 





Yesterday’s snacks.. It was a lot but I told myself to relax and just let myself have some sweets ‘n stuff :)  

ED CONFESSIONS 5now that I’ve made myself actually focus on what I’m dealing with, I realize it’s a lot worse than I ever played off. I’m actually afraid of some foods. Not like I’m gonna run away screaming but that being around it or seeing it, makes me really uncomfortable. A lot of times I’ve turned down events or pretended to be sick so I could avoid food situations, even though I really wanted to see my friends, I was scared I would binge at their party or whatever so I’d just stay home. Overeating literally makes me want to run away from my problems, going on an intermediate jog/run for an hour, just so I feel justified for having a “normal” meal, but because I ate it too fast or more than I planned or after I had begun to feel full, I feel the need to balance that with jumping up to 50 jumping jacks inbetween computer activities or studying just so I don’t feel like I’m sitting there, collecting fat and becoming an obese whale. I know after one meal a day or even two, I can never be 400 pounds or anything, but I guess I just have always wanted to be healthy and so eating unhealthy food makes me want to exersize to feel better. Eating clean is expensive though.. and I can’t afford to do that right now.. so my goal is one day to learn how to cook and make food I can feel good about having instead of all this easy fast food and microwaveable junk. I still want to have junk and unhealthy food sometimes  but not as my primary choice.I wanna be toned and shit and have energy but I can never have that if I’m throwing up everything I eat… let alone eating what I have as a selection so it’s just really frustrating.  

💌 i’ve been there.i’ve followed the tags, the blogs, the tips, the words, idolized faces without names. (all that mattered were that they were thin). i’ve even posted thinspo and torn myself up over meanspo.i’ve hated myself. i’ve restricted, drank three water bottles in one sitting, chewed gum. i’ve lied to family and friends.i know what it’s like to have an eating disorder and it’s not worth it.eating disorders do not discriminate, and that’s what’s so scary. but it doesn’t matter if you’re a boy, girl, adult, your race, your sexuality. you are valid. please seek help. please tell someone. i’m begging you.recovery can be a slow process, but each day, no matter the setback, is a step closer. take it from someone who was there. you won’t regret it. you’re so worth recovery. i’m so proud of you and i love you so much. ♡send me asks or pms if you have any questions or need support. they’re always open and i’m always here.eating disorder hotline: 1-800-931-2237 

Was reading a story and accidentally read Shawn as shawarma and I think that sums up my state of mind atm 

Lol just purged for the first time in months cos I have no self control :)))))))) 

Me, looking in a mirror: oh hey, I dont actually look that bad–
My Ed:
 

Guess who binged againnnn🐄 

I just noticed I have over 1,000 followers and I want to thank you all for following me butIt also breaks my heart knowing that there 1,000 people who have looked at my blog and followed me on a blog where I mostly vent. So while I have this platform, I want to say please choose recovery, if you’re new here please unfollow me, block me, whatever. I’m not a good influence and I want the best for all of you, and it’s not this. 

Got some new snacks for the following work days😊🙈
 

20.05.2019
Some things I did today that made me happy 🖤
• I didn’t go to school (´ｖ｀)
• I wore my new dress to go buy fruit 🍎🍓🍒 from the local market 
• I did 3 new drawings that I absolutely love 💗 

• I stayed under a calorie limit of 1000 💕 

*unpaid advertisement*
My first order from Coconut Bowls arrived☺️ I got myself a natural coconut bowl and a wooden buddha spoon🙈
I really need more of these soon😍😊✨ 

me: boy am i happy to be a recovering individual, loving life and eating food like a normal human!ed brain: Look At Old Pictures. Look At Them. Lose Weight So You Can Look Like That Again.me: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

I’d say my first 20 hr fast is going quite well
 

You know, I really think having something to take care when you struggle with depression/other mental health issues, it helps you stay motivated and take care of yourself. So, even if you’re just taking care if a fish or a flower, that lil dude needs you, and it just feels nice. Idk maybe it’s just me. 

My body is SO sensitive from all my years of restriction that now even unintentionally eating 25% less one day than I did the day before (which is still a very normalized amount for my size/age) makes me get dizzy/disoriented by bedtime. In related news: I’m eating a nightsnack now.  

I made the smoothie again, I am kind of shocked because I got really anxious, I planned my meals for the whole day to, and I was debating putting it down, but I did. I don’t know why, I feel guilty but… happy. I don’t know what to think right now. 

I think one of my biggest problems is that I’m still constantly comparing myself to others in every situation. Like why cant I just see my inherit worth as a person?  

“U r TOo HeALTY 4 hAVing an eD”My life in 8 words    

I’ve been eating like a mad man last few days, now I’m starting all over again, the good thing is.. I don’t feel as bad as I used to before, and honestly that’s like a really huge step I took.Like, okay I ate ton of food, I can’t do anything about it, I’ll exercise I’ll restrict a bit and its all okay❤️ 

So a couple months ago I started seeing a dietitian and I feel like after my session yesterday that I’m finally starting to make process with how I look at food and realize that I can make better choices. I’m just proud of myself for realizing that the situation I used to be in was not healthy and that I deserve to be my best self and at the end of the day gaining a little weight is nothing compared to the amount of mental stress I used to put on myself. I understand now that if I spend so much time hating my body I will never be able to appreciate all that it’s done for me. I shouldn’t hate my body just for it trying to take care of itself..It’s important to remember that your body is trying it’s best to take care of you and that you shouldn’t be mad at it for not doing exactly what your mind wants it to do. Your eating disorder is lying to you.  

Can you stop posting triggering ED things in the recovery tags please. At least give people a chance to escape this shit.  

Confessing my ice cream addiction.. 😇
 

welp i was well on my way to recover but guess whos backme 

tmiI HAD MY FIRST NATURAL POOP TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 2 MONTHS IM SO HAPPY AND PROUD OF MYSELF!!!!!!!!!! 

ED CONFESSIONS 3 or part 3 of ED C 2I stalled a few days on the finals part just because it to the most recent and so it makes it harder to share I guess. I know my s/o reads these too and so anyway I can help them understand can be benefitiual I suppose. So my 19th year I ceased in binging. I don’t know what it was but a switched turned off and I had no urge to binge, but then unfortunately not to eat very much and then eventually I felt guilty even having liquids and dump out my coffee and tea before I’d even drained half a cup. But that lasted half of that year.. maybe only 5 months.. and we moved houses and for some reason that started up the binging and purging again. I felt.. very out of control. Through out the years prior I’d attempted stopping, but I’d always fall back into it again. A little before I turned 20, I remember not caring if I died from my body not getting nutrients or my stomach exploding or whatever came to pass. Living was too hard if I had to do it in a constant cycle that seemed to dominate my whole existence. My next binge was all I would think about. Trying not to binge was all I thought of.How I would get it up was my only worry.Sometimes I remember feeling so frantic I would think, “ I don’t even care if I get caught, I just want it out.”I’ve purged in most all places. In the woods, the side of the road, the bathroom at whataburger, in my closet, in the shower, the stalls at school and college, a shoe box in the middle of my floor. It makes me sad.. that kind of desperation and then knowing I caused it. There was another calm from b/p, when my sweet one came back to me. We talked again.. I got to hear her voice, realize she still loved me, and I found I didn’t think about b/p for months. When I went to my grandparent’s I never thought to weigh myself. I didn’t have any bad thoughts. Then after a month and half I suppose I got used to it. The feeling of her closeness even though she was still far away, the pressure of the outside, and school and my office job. I started running and going on jogs, still binging but trying to cancel out the food with exersize.. and then sometimes I would I say fuck it and run for an hour, knowing it would make me sick, for double punishment, afterwards even making myself run a few my rounds because I deserved to.Then I ran and still b/p, getting back up to multiple times in a day.. Sometimes it would stop for a day or so but then come back.. mostly at night.. when I can’t sleep because of the insomnia..Then like some miracle, as if the world knew I needed saving, I posted about how I wanted to get better.. as I always did but just struggled with a true motivation I guess.. but to get better for her..Then she saw it.Our usual call that night was different. She was close to crying and being ashamed and sorta freaked out I kept on talking about random shit and then she straight up asked me, “ so how’s your ed been.”I didn’t deny it as I once did when she’d asked months before, nor try to weasel my way out, but I broke down and cried and said how bad it was lately. I guess I’d wanted to tell her, if anyone… but held against it because I didn’t want to worry her or make her upset or openly have anything wrong with me.. So we talked about everything really because she wanted to understand and she cried and I cried. I hate seeing her cry, even if she’s a pretty crier because I made her cry. Love is a pretty good reason not  to die ya’know.. cause I wanna grow old with her and not give out early. We pinkie swore I wouldn’t b/p for a week. I haven’t gone a week since I was just 19.. Despite that I was pretty upset with myself when I b/p after the third day. It happened because I felt like I was faking.. like maybe I neve had a problem.. so I ate cereal.. and then made pot of macaroni and then purged because well I had already half Way broken my promise so I might as well finish. After I texted her while she was asleep, explaining and apologizing. I knew she wouldn’t hate me but I guess I was more upset with myself.. This Friday when I’m with her, with be my first week b/p free and a time for me to be so very proud of her for graduating. We’re gonna cosplay and celebrate and see Aladdin and have the first sleepover in years and I’m so very happy and excited.I’m also excited to exist I guess but not just exist but live and get better. I thank God for her all the time, even though she calls me an angel.. she’s truly mine.💗💫 

this one aint about calories or whatever. its very easy to forget that rapid weightloss means you get drunk way faster. even after i dropped just 4 kg too fast (61-57 kg) i started getting drunk waaaaay quickerremember it pals. stay safe and know your limits and the conseqences of rapid weightloss! 

Breakfast: nothing-(0)Lunch: 1 package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/6 cup tomato sauce-(20)Dinner: 1 package seaweed snacks-(30), ½ package low-cal noodles-(20), 1/3 flavoring packet-(5)Total Intake: 95 caloriesToday was a really shitty day and I feel like a whale. I was going to go for a walk but I threw up and still feel sick so I’m just going to do some light exercise at home.   

babes if you have exams coming up please at least eat breakfast, your brain and body need something to be able to function and focus 💖 i know it will be difficult and you’ll feel guilty but you deserve to eat and you deserve to have the full ability to do your best on exams. eating breakfast will not make you gain weight. i promise.if the calorie count is distressing here are some low cal breakfast ideas:fresh fruit + plain greek yoghurt + little bit of honey (103 calories)boiled eggs (77 cal per egg)honey toast (2 slices = 190 cal)any type of egg fried or scrambled using coconut oil will be under or around 100 cal, add some veg like spinach or mushroomoatmeal with honey (99 cal)bowl of cheerios (103 cal) stay safe, drink water and take vitamin supplements (especially omega 3 for the brain!)  

According to my ED brain, the calories don’t count while I’m drunk which is great news cause I love alcohol  

Tried out flavor drops for the first time now and I still don’t know if I like them or not. I really love the idea but the taste of some of them is pretty artificial and way too sweet. But I like the vanilla ones. Maybe I just need to try other flavors someday🙈
 

Just a quick update from me! First of all excuse my stomach, it was extremely bloated when I took this picture a week ago and please excuse the bandage! So the updated:
I am still currently in hospital sectioned under the mental health act…ugh! But apparently I am making good progress, I have gotten more leave to go home and out with staff and on group leave, I’ve also started community skills which will lead to me getting unescorted leave (without staff) which will be amazing! I had a relapse last week with self-harm hence the bandage, and I’m also batting with my ED at the moment. It’s been very bad but I’m starting to be able to start recovering again because I did stop completely but I’m overcoming it again! I can and will do this. ❤️💜 I have CTP on Monday (care and treatment plan) so would love you all to send prayers and positive vibes my way and I’ll update you on that! I am nervous that my consultant psychiatrist will renew my section but it’s not worth fretting about right now! Anyway enough about me, how are you all doing? I hope everyone is okay and please remember to reach out when you need help, you can message me also! ☺️ 

my parents said no to getting a digital scale because i feel like the scale i have is inaccurate they don’t want me to get addicted to a scale and the numbers, but little do they know that i already have a scale that i snatched from them a few months ago  

Quick rantStop posting shit in the recovery tags that literally tell you to starve yourself. Pro recovery is for PRO RECOVERY. Gtfo with your “not pro recovery just using tags” like bitch stop then.  Ps. Kudos to the amazing sweeties who post their stories about their recovery for everyone to read, your amazing and I love you ✌️ 



Yesterday’s challenge: healthy oils🌿
Very very scary but important🙈 

honestly people with EDs that are less than 18 y/o make me feel like crying because of how fucked up is our societylike a kid is literally starving because everyone around them is telling them it’s good to be doing it??ED sufferers mostly start behaviours at a very young age (I’m talking about 12-16 y/o up to 20) and I’m here just hoping no kid ever will be suffering because people in their life tell them it’s good to lose weight that way for whatever fucking reasonI see thinspo and anorexia/bulimia blogs who are 13 to 15 y/ojustpleaseget out now that’s starting because when you’re this deep you won’t be able to no matter how hard you try. the more it stays with you the more it’ll want to stay with you.  

Morning bodycheck 
 

Life is rough when you’re stomach is empty AND you’re a fat ass  



I ate way too little yesterday and I just couldn’t let my ED voice in my head win so I thought about it for like over an hour and then decided to just do it and buy myself really good ice cream. At first I thought I can not finish it after a few scoops and I put it back in the freezer but then after a few hours my stomach felt better and I could eat the whole pint. With the ice cream I had about  2300 calories in total then and I didn’t let Ana control my life that day :)  

Time to get helpI’m slipping back into old habits. The past three days I’ve eaten a banana and one tortilla. Because of this, I feel tired. Cranky. Weak. Cold. Sick. All the bad things about a restrictive diet. I’ve thought for a while now I would be able to recover without the help of a counselor, but with the amount of mini-relapses like this I have decided it’s time to reach out and find a therapist. It’s a big step, but one I need to take.  

Some days you crave salad and do for a long walk in the park. Others you do not work at all and crave cheesecake. Neither days are a waste and should be looked at in a negative way. Life involves eating a wide variety of foods and enjoying a wide range of experiences. Do not let how much you have exercised or how many calories determines the worth or value of your day.  

I attended an information session yesterday about goal setting and things to invest in with my time and energy to help move me forward in the direction of my goals. I’m currently doing placement for my Certificate in Education Support and hopefully in a few months will be a qualified Teacher Aide. I’m halfway through my counselling degree at university and then want to do a graduate diploma in mental health and one day be a trauma counsellor for children. I have so many goals and I love that. Some of my writing is soon to be published again even if only for a newsletter. I’m spending time around the piano and trumpet with little children and I’m wanting to have my book published. I want to be a speaker and a writer. I have the ability to influence daily. I have children in my life almost every day of the week through work every day and placement. I’m a little exhausted at the moment but it’s all worth it. I can influence and impact as I go, and I’m thankful for the journey 💖 

I’m ill and bored…send me askssss 😸😸😸😸 



smiling because of anxiety not happiness..  

If any of my witchy followers could send a weight loss spell my direction that would be great please and thanks  

Day 2 fasting after yet another bingeIt’s real tiring being in the recovery cycle then being switched on to starvation mode. It’s been going on for 3 months now and it’s SO WEIRD. Like the more I eat, the harder it’s getting to starve. Like I’m already tired and shaking??? And it’s only been like 45 hours since my last meal. I did better before I tried recovery. So I guess it actually kinda helps the body to eat more, but I’m not gonna lie I feel like my mental is even worse? I almost hate myself more now than when I got to this treatment home. But yeah. Even though I’m in a “IM DOING WHATEVER IT TAKES TO BE SKINNY” mood, I still miss my life. I miss school and I miss dancing✨ 

So where the fuck have I been!So I recovered last year briefly before my fat ass lost control and started binging again. Now I’m almost back at my SW. Luckily didn’t gain it all back and now I’m 167.7 lbs instead of my 136.6 lbs  

Thank you to everyone for all the kind messages, you’re all making recovery that much easier  

Lmao my boyfriend’s dad was telling us how much better spaghetti squash is than actual spaghetti noodles…. Let me make this clear, while I do eat spaghetti squash, it’s def not anything I’d substitute for actual spaghetti….plz noI’ll keep my carbs, thanks. 



Having some healthy snacks on my way to my boyfriend. These are like fruit rolls I used to do some time ago :)  

I tend to get really bad stomach ache after a binge, because I keep eating even though I feel like my stomach is going to explode until there’s no more food.Like, my only way of dealing with this right now is to just not have food at home. I literally have like 3-4 things in my fridge, but today I bought a bigger pack of food than usual, because it was cheaper and i ended up eating it all. i’m so annoyed, because i’m okay with fasting for a few days, but as soon as i have something to eat, i will eat it all. I feel like it’s slowing down my progress so much. Please don’t say “try eating more and regularly”, because it’s definitely not gonna work. I’ve been like that even before my ed, when I was eating “normally”.Help me please. 

I want to be made up of just bones so that no one can touch me  

Me body checking for the 100th time today and still being fat 

I’m kinda just realizing how sick I actually was?? 

…I think I’ve grown and swallowed my eating disorder like how a tree grows and swallows barbed wire and there’s no way to cut it out of me 

Food log 5/7/19Breakfast:1 cup fresh cut watermelon - 46 caloriesGrande lemonade, peach Infusion, sf vanilla - 130 caloriesTall mocha cookie crumble, soy, no whip - 240 caloriesTotal: 416 caloriesLunch:Starbucks egg white bites - 170 caloriesGrande lemonade, strawberry infusion, sf vanilla - 130 caloriesGrande Mango refresher, peach infusion, sf vanilla - I couldn’t figure out the calories here because both the peach infusion and sf vanilla are 0 calories. I know that sweetened this drink is 80 calories, so I’m assuming without the sweetened (10 calories a pump/4 pumps for a grande) this drink is about 40 calories or so????Total: unknownSnacks:Vegan frosted blueberry donut - the sign at Whole Foods said 540, but online it said 240 so I really don’t know the calories here.Vegan oatmeal raisin cookie- the sign said 260, but online said 208 calories so still I don’t know the calories here.Strawberry lime pepper popsicle - this is from a local coffee shop where I live so again the calorie amount is unknown and I’m guessing it was less than 60 calories since it is fresh and not processed.Total: unknownDinner: cheese and mayo sandwichLow calorie bread - 90 caloriesMayo - 40 caloriesProvolone cheese - 70 caloriesTotal: 200 caloriesTotal for the day: 1,491 caloriesThis is just the number I roughly estimated into my calorie app. It is most like no where near correct, but like I said it’s hist a rough estimate.Weight: 137lbsI’m upset with my choices again today. I need to stop getting so many drinks when I work my shifts at Starbucks. My drinks make up the majority of my calorie intake for the day because I get up to 3 a day sometimes 4. I need to drink water during my breaks and lunches instead of drinks and limit myself to 1 tall drink when I get off. I will do better tomorrow.

Although I couldn’t finish it (because of the snacks I had before and because it was way too much) I am still proud of myself🐝✨
Other, way way bigger challenge was ordering something else than water, I haven’t had any real liquid calories for a long time and it scares me even more than some high calorie foods. 

 

UpdateSo, a update on how things ate going, well yesterday and before that were okay, I was definitely struggling to get my calories in, had about 950 both days, and today I didn’t count. I think I am around 1700, I pushed myself really hard!Thinking about how well today went makes me smile, I have eaten a little candy(had a sugar crash), got a sugar headache(I don’t usually eat anything with +5g sugar) I even had chicken stir fry for dinner, my favourite! My weight is a little strange right now, I am pretty bloated and my body isn’t reacting well to my low calorie days, hopefully it’ll even out soon as I try to drink more smoothies and have apple sauce or pineapple.(I actually have a sensitivity to any citres fruits, including pineapple but whatever.) 

I justI just want to be skinnyI just want to be prettyI just want to feel small and daintyI just want my boyfriend to be able to throw me around or pick me up like I’m nothingI just want people to stop judging me for the lack of or large amounts of food I eatI just want the ones I love to understand the pain I feel when I look in the mirrorI just want them to hold me and say “I know but it will get better”I just want the weight to magically disappearI just want to be able to fit into the cute clothes my friends wearI just want to stop being the fat friendI just want to stop feeling like thisI just want to quit being so sensitive when it comes to my weight and not take everything so personallyI just wish girls wouldn’t act like I’m huge I just want happiness. and in my mind, happiness = skinniness.  

ive seen so many people disguise healthy eating and healthy weight loss tips as ana tips and you’re the real ones tbh , got me eating low cal meals and doing small fasts at night instead of skipping meals and not eating for days. it’s not perfect but those healthier tips save lives  

baking some delicious chewy chocolate chips for my grandmas birthday tomorrow ! i wanted to make something mostly everyone would like , and they taste amazing so im very excited for everyone to try !!

ReflectionSo I have just finished my first year of college. Currently, I’m struggling a little bit, but I wanted to take some time to reflect on how far I really have come. 2 years ago, I didn’t think I’d make it. I was so wrapped up in my ED that it was all I cared about. And then the summer of 2017 changed my life when I went inpatient. I started my senior year of high school just a few days after I got home from treatment. But that school year was different from all my others. I had a voice I never knew I had. I made friends and got an amazing boyfriend. Then college came. Some days were rough, but to be honest, I love my school. I have earned opportunities I would have never imagined for myself, and I feel like a part of the community for once. Next semester I will start my job as a Resident Assistant, something I’m super excited for. I have many more things planned as well. So maybe I’m struggling a little right now, but I have overcome so much, and I truly cant wait to see what the future holds. Recovery is worth it. 



Today’s morning and night snack🍭🍬 

So i saw another counselor today. It was super weird and hard. Mainly hard because she asked some specific questions that the other lady hadn’t brought up. I’m supposed to go back to her sometime soon, but i’m not sure if i’ll continue because she makes me slightly uncomfortable.  

Gotta love my stomach rumbling/churning and my shivering keeping my boyfriend awake 🙃🙃🙃 

5/24/19Breakfast: apple juice boxLunch: a whole bag of cassava lime chips and a stick of rhubarb Dinner: steamed mixed veggies and chicken breast stuffed with feta, bacon, and asparagus Also a glass of Pinot Noir 

09.05.19 // FDOE //
Breakfast was a chocolate protein fluff and a white curry omelette :)


For lunch I made a really good soup which filled me up quite a lot (and I challenged myself to have bread with it, even though it’s a fear food and I never add anything else to my lunch because of the cals) 🙈 


Before work I tried these chocolate coated banana chips. And I really loved them *-*


At work I had some snacks and I ate one more portion of my home made veggie soup :)

it would mean the actual world for you guys to check out my newest video and maybe subscribing to me, i been tryna find something that motivates me to stay another day here and i really want this channel to grow, ily all 

Long Time No PostI’ve been gone for a while mostly because I’ve on and off with actually having an ED. I’m back now and I’m super fat ready to lose weight and be perfect. I have a lot of AP tests coming up so when I’m not studying I plan to go on runs or walk my dogs now that the weather is better. I can’t purge anymore (which suck because I like purging) so I need to develop self control. If anyone wants to be my ana buddy and help me out I’m open.  

Hey! First of all, thank you so much for sending in this ask and thank you for your kind words. To answer your first question, in short, yeah. It does get easier. Will it become so easy that you never think about it again? No. Will it become so easy that you never ever have the chance of relapsing again? No. But that doesn’t mean you’ll spend your whole life anxious and nervous about what you eat. Keep reading 

unpopular opinion but if you write meanspo you are a terrible person and deserve nothing good 

PSA 🌸 I was SO upset about my binge yesterday but I actually lost a pound when I weighed myself this morning! it just goes to show that one binge is not going to ruin all of your progress and that you may actually lose more weight by upping your caloric intake a bit. if you have been severely restricting for an extended period of time, please eat. if you have been fasting and feel faint, please eat.please be safe everyone. 🌸  



Tea time😄 

new ana bloghey everyone.. I have new ana blog and am looking for some people to follow who deal with similar things. while the blog is new my ed is not, I’ve had anorexia for about 4 years now with many ups and downs. I look forward to meeting you :)-lana  

why recovery. all those anorexics from 2014 have fully recovered by now. even if not, they’re on the road to it. why? maybe cause they WANT A DAMN LIFE.if anyone reading this is from the Ed community, or wants to begin having an ed, this is your sign to STOP. maybe this would interest you:you reach your ugw. you’re really excited. but all you do is shyly sip your green tea and slip under your covers that consists of 3 blankets. you still feel so cold. you run your fingers through your hair, oh dear, more strands are falling out. you decide to get up and be productive. yeah, how about cleaning your room? you pass by the mirror, and despite looking like a stick thin mess, your skin is dry and flaking away, your nails are brittle and awfully blue, your muscles hurt after not taking in protein for so long. and your period? it’s been gone longer.you decide to never go out again, fearing that you’ll have to eat food. that’s fine, you just need school/work and then you’ll come back home. but wherever the fuck is your social life?eating disorders help girls get skinny. but does that include having a LIFE? no.and by the time you eat normally again, you’re just going to gain back all that weight, heck, even ABOVE your sw in the first place.even if you want to lose weight, ed’s are NOT the way. you’re just finding the lazy way out by discarding your entire life to lose weight rapidly. but why not take the hardworking way by actually eating 1500 calories and working out, and STILL LIVE A FUCKING LIFE?this is your sign to STOP. remember, recovery has always got your back.  

recovery from an ED is baby stepsMore words from my therapist!! For all of you wanting a way out of, or help starting recovery from an ED(anorexia in this case)This is kind of a short one, a single-tip post, but important nonetheless!!Recovery isn’t immediate. You don’t start eating or stop feeling urging to restrict just magically. Even if you aren’t currently restricting due to lapses and relapses and the way those work; you can’t magically stop relapsing either.So here’s what my therapist gave me about that: When you feel an urge to restrict or a relapse coming back, obviously it is ideal you fight the relapse and don’t restrict. But since it can often be inevitable, try upping your restrictions just a little every time. Restricting 300? Try 500. Next time you relapse, now that you’ve gotten cozy at 500? Do 600 or 700. Even if it takes a few months or even a year, your ‘restricting’ can be reduced to 1000 calories. Then from there, or even during this process, you can work on other things, as this is just one facet method of recovery out of the whole process.I myseld don’t plan to recover soon, but for those who do or are, this one is for y’all!! <33 

like/reblog/comment if you are at least 18yo and you have any kind of ed-related blog that’s active.(this is a side blog so i will follow you from my main one - @littleartythings) 



This is my plan for May/June. Days after 530 are all either fasting or 1000kcal. For days that are 1000kcal, I’ll use the lower calorie days to mix and match meals. The workouts listed are my mandatory workouts, but I will likely do more than that (especially on my 1000kcal days), as I like to bike/row at the gym and discover new workouts on YouTube. If I’ve had an especially brutal workout, I’ll eat this afterward to make sure my lean muscle sticks around and I’m not fatigued the next day: 
- 1/3-1/12 cup chickpeas, red onion, diced tomato, cucumber, 1 packet tuna + salt, pepper, garlic powder, and whatever other seasonings I happen to want + olive oil drizzle (usually no more than 1tsp). This comes out to about 300kcal, and is really good because it’s filling, full of protein, and has lots of nutrients. If you go way too hard on your workout, PLEASE consider eating something extra like this! Even just a protein shake is okay. Your progress will probably go faster, I promise. 
Stay safe, sweet babies.  

I think I might have a serious tea addiction🍵
 



06/05/2019
I had the daily check in with G, told her that I’d pre made my lunch, I can’t believe how much it helped. I didn’t go down those automatic neural pathways. TW It was the first time in, probably years (aside from the handful of times when I came home from hospital) that I didn’t pick corners off of my sandwich. We discussed a little about self compassion, treating myself as I would a loved one, and that includes presenting and making my food as I would for someone else. I don’t make sandwiches for others any more, but sometimes I make Mum some toast and I don’t pick the corners off and make it all horrible. I won’t lie I did struggle with weighing the apple as usual. But I had an increased filling in my sandwich and ate all of the bread. I was worried about it, but I did it and well I’ve proved nothing ‘happens’. I can’t believe the number of behaviours I broke during this.
Ok, another iffy thing. Hunger. I’ve been starving since 2.30am last night. I woke up at about 1.30 and was tossing and turning, then my stomach started rumbling. I was going to try a different breakfast but was worried about fullness too much. I worry about ‘doing things differently’ as in eating more (like the amount I should have/a planned amount - not a response to the hunger) when I am hungry because my head says I’m ‘out of control’ and ‘binging as a response to the hunger’, but I did lunch. I was really full from lunch but not ‘satisfied’ and I think it’s because I’m stuck on the same foods? I had the same snack this afternoon and my stomach just feels empty and idk why. I’m not going to tell anyone at home as I get shouted at that I don’t respond, but I’m going to keep with my plans and I might challenge dessert/supper tonight. I’m also going to increase my portion at tea without using rituals to compensate. 
One thing G said the other day was that I need to go out of my comfort zone but in bigger ways, and making my way through the central column (the ‘foods/rules to introduce’ one) is a way to start it 🤔
My parents are back, and I asked them (obviously they’ve been back quite a while now😆) if they think I could manage something different at breakfast (I’ll not say what in case of triggers) and Dad said yes, or is there anything more calorific I could have? And I said well I was asking because I had fancied that food, and Mum got a bit angry and said it’s not what I fancy it’s getting calories in which is a bit annoying because I do force things in that I would rather have a lower thing to get calories in anyway too, and it takes a lot to consider having things I fancy. But equally, there are higher things too that I’ve been fancying. So I guess it’s that balance, but importantly, starting.
I’m really bored! So I might go on Sims or something now to pass some time. I can’t concentrate on my book as I’m feeling, ugh, the ‘h’ word, plus dad has the tv on, so I might either do that or maybe some collaging hmm.. 

I look down at myself and this is what I see
People always tell me that I’m too skinny, my doctors say I’m underweight 
But every time I look down at myself this is what I see
I’m not all skin and bones
I don’t look like I’ve been suffering anorexia longer than I can remember 
I look down and I see fat
Not the lean flat stomach I used to have
Not all super bony
Just this
But it always looks bigger in person than through the phone somehow
The irony of this pain is I’m attracted to bigger men and women
But I criticize myself and see myself as fat
And them not 
I see myself differently than others and how I see things doesn’t make sense
And it’s difficult and annoying 
And no one ever listens when I start to fall back into this
No one ever seems to know what to say without making things worse
I tried telling the person who is supposed to be my biggest support
And he turned it into a reason to make a blowjob joke 
I’m hurting inside but I can’t seem to express it to those who should help
So I’ve fallen back to the ana community 
Caving into my fears
And crying when I look at my body 

For me eating carbs is too difficult rn, i will eat more fish, meat and eggs(and fruit and vegetables).It’s even better than not eating at all….right? 

now that i’m almost “fully recovered” i always feel really uncomfortable about talking about my past with eating disorders. i feel like almost ashamed of it? and i know boundaries and all that are okay to have but like it’s hard to even talk to my parents about it or even to my therapist sometimes. bad memories i guess 



Yesterday’s lunch was really hard to finish. I usually don’t eat pasta because everything about it scares me and to be honest I don’t even like it that much. I’d rather have some fresh veggies..
But my mom made pasta and there was nothing else there and I decided to try it. It was okay but not in my taste.
I ate about 3000 calories because I need to gain weight even though it is such a bad feeling..  

Recently ive been drinking so much sugar free watermelon volvic because she tastes so freaking good and theres only 2 calories in every 250 ml! Thats fuckin wild man i love sugar free water melon volvic 

I just tried to open up to my sister about how much I hate my body, and how insecure I am. I told her how a lot of it stems from the way my mom talks to me (“ I thought you wanted to be skinny” and “Wow, can’t control yourself around food can you” are common ones) and she got mad at me. She told me “not everything’s about you you know” and left before I could say anything. So. That’s fun. 

Stop listening to your ED thoughts and posting them on the fucking internet. That’s not “venting”, that’s dwelling. That’s giving power to your disordered thoughts. It’s not helping anyone. You should be challenging those thoughts and replacing them with productive ones. Don’t let your ED thoughts win and do NOT share them online to bring other people down. 

I’m in that weird acceptance phase where I don’t want to wake up in the morning, but I’m constantly checking my HRbecause I don’t think I want to dieand I think my heart is going to stop 

I will tell myself that life is beautiful until I believe it  

I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. I hate how I look. I feel and look gross. I feel nauseated looking at myself. I hate it. Everything feels dirty. Part of the reason I have struggled with anorexia is because I feel food makes me ‘dirty’, that fullness is a dirty/contamination feeling. I feel revolting inside. I want to strip everything out of my bedroom. Throw all my clothes away, paint my walls, get rid of everything. The only things to be held onto are the sentimentals, but everything relating to hospital and things I relate to anorexia I want gone. But it’s not going to wipe it away. That’s not going to make me recover. The reason I feel this way is because I am underweight, and I am in energy deficit. The only way out is to push through these sh*tty feelings and realise that a) they do not hurt me, b) they pass, c) getting through will help me get to the other side and will help.Just this feeling of wanting to be better is making me want to cry, is all.

Me, scrolling through thinspo:
 

Even though my GW is only 20 lbs away, I don’t think I’ll hit it by July. It’s not that I won’t make that much progress, but if I’m building lean muscle from my workouts, then the number on the scale probably won’t change as much. But my measurements will. So I’m wondering if I should go by that instead? Someday I’ll be really toned and a tiny 110, but if I’m building muscle while losing weight, it’s almost like losing 40 lbs instead of 20. I don’t want to trick myself into thinking I’m not making progress when really, my goal is just farther away than I originally thought. What do you guys think?  



Tried out Protein Fluff from Pumperlgsund and it’s deliciooouuss😊😊😊 *unpaid and not sponsored advertisement* 

Can’t win I had another pretty bad relapse. I binged really bad Saturday night and today. I had done so long and now I can’t go a couple of days. Why am I such a failure. 😞 

One of those days when I feel like I’m eating ‘a lot’ and ‘too much’. Had snack regardless. Well, I wouldn’t have been able to get out of it but I didn’t scrimp. Kind of wishing I’d challenged myself but then again I reckon that’s because a lot of the challenges I have in are lower calorie. I’m a bit scared of challenging stuff for that extreme guilt feeling like I got last week. I can’t keep running back to anorexia. I have to at least give it a shot and not run back or else my body will never learn and not know what it is doing. If I’ve maintained my weight for 10+ weeks then I have to make changes. I don’t want to gain weight, but want to be a healthy weight and I just have to go through the process of eating more > gain weight. Like going through this sh*tty process in order to get to the other side. This idea of the other side came from watching a vlog earlier, and it was comforting. The idea that you go over this hurdle and then have a relief after. But I know I have a hell of a long way to go. I shouldn’t do, after 6 years of ‘recovery’ and 10 years of anorexia, but I do. I’m still scratting around trying to do something, I haven’t moved on at all. I in fact went through a load of old bits of paper (note, from the last few months) and it was filled with meal plans and food lists, and it’s staggering how limited my food choices have become and how many houses I have gone around. I found the binder I used in hospital and my diary and some bits and I felt physically sick at the thought of it again but that is the reality of what will happen if I do not change my ways and get on with it. And that is what it is. Getting on with it. I will say it again but I have been maintaining on roughly 1800 calories, if that, and if I give 2300 a real go. Just flipping give it a go and properly. Not pulling bits of bread off sandwiches and giving the cat bits of tuna from the sandwich and breaking bits of Weetabix off and hiding food under the plate. I feel really sick and like I’m eating ‘too much’, but that is dillusional, because I know the facts and I know what I have eaten. That is showing how much I do need it because it shows how twisted anorexia is making my mind, how malnourished it is and how riddled with dillusional thoughts it is. It reallt scares me having these thoughts because if I don’t get over this barrier then I won’t ever recover. So I guess it is a case of closing my eyes and doing mechanical eating until it feels better. I guess it is all the ‘messyness’ (yuck, I hate using that term) and dibbing and dabbing, missing snacks and then not, having low cal teas then high cal teas and I think it all feels a bit up in the air. Also, tmi but bowel movements have been a bit all over too, if I go then I feel sick and it triggers me, if I don’t then I get acid reflux and feel full which triggers me. So I think I probably feel triggered by that too (I have noticed this in the past and I guess I have to remember that these feelings are real but not ‘true’, I don’t need to act on uncomfortable stomach feelings because my stomach is not representative of a normal stomach, ESPECIALLY not with this restrict/try to recover again/restrict cycle I am in. I think it’s frightening because I do feel very alone with it, with no support really at home any more, so it feels scary and like something genuinely bad will happen, and this is when I need to be strong and do it on my own.I suppose, I am writing that to get it out but also hold myself accountable. Maybe, I think I need to commit. No more missing snacks. No more low calorie, stupid evening meals. No more not measuring my food out right and no more throwing food away. I do relate to a lot of what Tabitha Farrar says and I think it is that lack of commitment which causes the anxiety, probably not the food itself. If I commit and say, I am having the food whether I like it or not, I am not skipping snacks/meals any more, I am committing to doing this even if I feel rubbish or anorexia is loud, I am not eating ‘too much’, I am committing to x calories and weight restoration from here on in, I am not throwing food away and I am not making my portions smaller than my meal plan to justify not throwing food away.It’s a frightening prospect and I feel gross, but that does not mean I AM gross. I want to be like my inspirations and I want to have a head free from thoughts. That is what I want more than anything, a head free from nasty thoughts and numbers. It won’t ever go away if I keep doing the actions linked to the thoughts as it reinforces they are ‘right’. The only way to reinforce that they are ‘wrong’ is to go against them. Kind of like a child constantly writing 2+2=5, and then trying to believe the answer is 4. They will learn the answer is 5 when really it is 4, because they are doing the action of writing 5 and it will reinforce in their brain it is 5.  Ok I know that’s random but it helped me see it in my head. I have learned that guilt and anxiety are appropriate responses to food and restriction a response to triggers because I have trained my brain into thinking that way, it doesn’t make it right and the only way to retrain my brain is to do the opposite and not engage with those feelings. I have to break that cycle which feels daunting, but it doesn’t make it daunting. Feelings are not facts and I am not my feelings. I have to be strong and brave. 

Decided to conquer my anxiety by doing a presentation without a group. Here we go. 

Recovery Is PossibleI know it’s strainingI know it can be hard to manageI know it effects you mentally, physically, and emotionallyI know it’s hardBut you can do it. I believe in you. 



me when ive had under 400 calories the whole day but the urge to make myself throw up is so strong i can barely take it  

can i just…I got a job, im the co captain of my organization, my hair is growing, i have money, i drink water everyday, i sleep early, i take vitamins, i use calming lotion every day and night, i brush my teeth, i dont eat more than one meal a day… So when am i going to be beautiful?I have to, have to, be enough. I have to lose weight and i have to be dainty so that this summer when i go to the beach i can wear a bikini, so that when i go back to school, i will be different. I will have long hair, so that i can pull it up with cute scrunchies. I will be thin and dainty and fragile. I cannot live in this body anymore. I will change, even if that means going days without eating anything. I will count calories again, go on week long water fasts, whatever it takes.(I am not promoting eds, this has been building up for months. Please be safe.) 

hii need an anabuddie so pls dm me y’all  

May 21, 2019💕💫so made it roughly 32 hours with no binge or purge. When my goal is a week it doesn’t feel like much but each hour makes me strong. 3 weeks could form habit.I feel good tonight. The roof of my mouth is still sore and awfully sensitive from all the acid and stuff.. maybe in a week it’ll feel better? Recovery is hard ya know, but it was even harder seeing her cry, knowing I caused it. It was exactly what I feared and maybe way I didn’t tell her for so long, but yesturday we talked about it. I told her how b/p made me feel, how long my ed has really existed.. and I felt better.. but also crazy ashamed. But I needed to tell her and I guess I needed to see how she felt about it. I knew it would upset her but I needed to see it for it to really matter.For me to realize that I can’t do this by myself. I tried on and off to stop and failed but she’s that extra source of energy or push to keep going and not giving up and succumb to evil habits or thoughts. She always asks me if I’ve eaten which unreasonably gives me tiny anxiety but it’s normal.. it also fills me with how much she loves me. She cares about me, same as I’d want her to be okay. I didn’t want her to worry over me but she’s always gonna, same as I will. I just don’t want to be a burden ya know? She reads this ( I think) so I’m sure she’ll say I’m not and maybe I’m not but I can’t help feeling that way. I helped her once in a way when she selfharmed and I made her happy, but I couldn’t always stop it from happening. In the end she got better with support of her family and a wonderful place.. I don’t want to go to a clinic or anything.. I’m scared of that.. I’m needed at home.. it would be horrible sitituation having my family involved.. and I just, no.So I can’t let it come to that.One week at a time. I’ll get better. ( I prolly won’t update every day but just when I feel the need… )Stay safe babes and bois~💗💫 

Hey guys, I just wanted to share this tip that helps me because I find it pretty beneficial. I’m pretty focused on eco friendly and zero waste, especially as of lately. So while we all have slip ups and eat that nasty heveanly produced food, I usually try to eat pretty clean. One thing that helps me to eat clean, eat less, and when I’m fasting is to remember that it’s lest food, waste, etc going towards the earth when I buy carrots instead of bagels (my fucking weaknes). Or when I’m fasting/restricting and really want one of my weakness foods, it helps me to remember that I’m also helping to prevent more waste from going into the earth. I’d rather spend my time watering my plants anyways. 🌱  

Had been going pretty strong in recovery but today I tried on swimsuits and bought green tea pills and now I’m spiraling 

i was thinking a lot…this is my last year of high school and I’ve understood how the school system is ruining a lot of lives. students, kids, teenagers locked up in a room for hours, forced to do many many many many many subjects, stuff that not everyone has a feel for. But the problem isn’t that…the problem is how school can become everything that u live, how something that is important but not crucial become the life of the student instead of being part of it.I had so many interests, I was capable of doing so many things, but school just took me away everything…I was only seeing myself doing things that I didn’t like and couldn’t do. Seeing always myself not being successful, seeing always myself tripping and never getting up made me depressed, I started hating myself a lot, I was seeing others living, I saw everything moving on while I was drowning, incapable to breath. that kind of living was killing me slowly, I was blaming myself a lot, I couldn’t understand how I wasn’t able to walk and others were able to run. Only by experiencing life how it truly is (and that is the hardest part, starting to walk again) I understood that this life isn’t for me…how can someone do ONLY things that they don’t like, HOW? Remember, the problem isnt  u, u are capable of many things, things you couldn’t even try.Remember, this society is a mess, they see everything as something that can make the state richer, they only see humans as products, they are  turning us, people made of feelings, love and perceptions, into computer to fulfill with informations. Remember that u are not supposed to live like this.Remember that u are not alone. 

You are what you need, don’t forget it.  

RecoveryJust deleted the post with the most notes on my whole blog, because it was thinspo and eating disorder related and I wanna fully commit to recovery If you were following me for ed-motivation-purpose, then feel free to unfollow. I wanna promote healthy living and will share my journey of starting to accept myself, dealing with studies and conquering my mental disorders.Please be kind 

Started a 24 hour fast as of now!!See you at 7pm tomorrow food. 

some of y’all are going to be mad at me, but it must be said.tagging a post that is encouraging anorexic or bulimic behaviors as “pro recovery” is disgusting. sweetspo is not pro-recovery. you saying “this post is a personal reminder for ME!!!” and tagging it as pro fucking recovery ???? that’s not just for you. anyone can see it. stop being delusional. 

before you go on and tell yourself how worthless you aregoogle the price of your body on the black market! 

How many calories in bonjela?asking for a friend… 

guilty pleasures be like: putting your height into a bmi calculator and changing your weight lower and lower as you imagine what that will be like once you get there 

one year after being released from the hospital for anorexia nervosa and acute food refusal i have… learned to love my bodydeveloped a healthy relationship with foodbegan to focus on my relationships with other peoplegotten my period had my heart rate improvehad SO MUCH energy. i’ve been able to exercise without passing outgotten way more compliments about my body. “you look so healthy !!”gotten much thicker and healthier hairno longer have dark circles under my eyes i’m not tired all the time anymorei’m so much strongerlife is so much better.please try to recover. it’s not fun. but i swear, it will be worth it. 

Today i am going to do something different.It’s not monumental bigger picture thinking, but I’m going to take myself to the shopping centre to get some things. I haven’t been in well over a month, and I can’t remember the last time I went on my own. I have a number of reasons why I always go with my parents, getting a lift so I don’t have to pay for train fare because it’s too much and I’m not worthy, and one other thing that has started cropping up (or has always been there but I can identify it?) is this needing to ‘prove to people’. It’s one reason why I restrict/struggle with meals/challenges in the day because I feel ‘no-one will believe me if I do it so what is the point?’. So this translates across to the shopping because I think I need to ‘show’ to people ‘oh look I’m strong/up to date enough to buy xyz for myself and I can walk around with bags of shopping and look like a normal person’. But, no. I am doing this for me. I’m going to take myself shopping because I have quite a lot of spare time sadly, and it gets me really anxious when I go at the weekend when it is busy, I am doing it because I really need some bits as I am literally living in the same pair of trousers atm (because even my harems/joggers make me feel depressed, so I’m wearing these cropped loose viscose summery patterned trousers) and I’ve had the same pjs for 4 years so I could probably do with some new ones too😬 and now I have identified this, it also needs to be applied across the board: eating proper meals when my parents are away this weekend, not just resorting to lemon fish and tiny portions of couscous, ensuring I eat all of my lunches, ensuring I make a proper sandwich, challenging different foods in the day and not gravitating towards the same Weetabix/tuna sandwich/apple/yogurt/nature valley bar combo every single day, not not allowing myself to rest in the day because nobody has seen me and they will think I’ve been on my feet and make me rest later. Because I am eating, I am doing this for me and my future, and because my brain will be the one that knows when I have done these things and will remember whether other people are there or not. I am doing this so in seven/eight months time when Christmas rolls around, I won’t be sat starving all day for a small portion of Christmas dinner and still eating the same breakfast and making myself go on a walk around the block, absolutely freezing. I am doing this so in a years time, five years time, five months time, I won’t be still sat doing the same. So I am not still looking at accounts from 5 years ago wishing I had done it then.So yes, today’s mission is have an early lunch, and get on the train to the shopping centre. I don’t think I will have a cup of tea out because the off peak train times finish before 4 so I’ll probably get the train around 3-3.30 and come home for snack. But it’s small steps and not really a disordered thing, it’s more monetary costing savings 🙈 



Are you more into coffee or tea?🌿
I personally drink a lot of tea and I love it. But sometimes I like to have coffee too. But I’ll usually put like 3 vanilla flavor drops from Got7 Nutrition inside my black coffee☕😍

a short representation of myself;eating nothing for 72h straight, then gets nervous about a small carrot“GOD I’M SUCH A FAT COW”OReating for like 3 days straight with a calories intake over 1000+ “what is even a workout” 

I may be tired all the time and I may feel a bit dizzy BUT the number on the scale is dropping so I’m happy  

Update and taking a break (TW)So I wound up binging really bad again tonight. I probably wound up having about 4,500 for the day. Most of which was candy and ice cream. I’ve found myself become fixated on dieting and food lately which is causing me to binge. This is the third binge this week. This is not good bye forever but I need some time to step away from social media and refocus myslef on finding a balance bewreen restrictionists and binges.  

Why get dinner,when you could get thinner?Is a toxic thought that I should not be having yet here we are 

Yesterday I tried really hard.. I told myself that it’s all okay and that I need the calories. But at night it hit me.. I was panicking so much, I just wanted to turn back the time and eat like 2000 calories less.. I still don’t feel good about it, not at all.. But today is a new day and I won’t restrict!! I will not give up, even though I hate every single aspect of recovery right now..  

Today I had a craving for peanut butter and so I ate it and it felt really good so for the first time in a very long time I enjoyed the food I was eating :) (I only had a little) 



06/05/2019
(Apologies for two food posts in one day 🙈)
I broke lots of behaviours again with tea (this is my ‘safe’ tea but I struggle with behaviours) and also increased the portion. I ate this with my parents, and I did struggle a little with physical fullness but it tasted a lot better. I then went on to have a challenging dessert. It’s so weird but I think I’m going off frozen muller rice, I ended up warming a bit of it up to try! (Even though I’d frozen it, so pray4me that I don’t poison myself warning frozen food😶) I find the original ones hard atm, so having a flavoured one was v challenging but I’m sick of ‘craving’ (ugh) foods and thinking about it, so this satisfied me a little. It was quite nice I think I’d have it again! I’m glad I did the behavioural breaking things at tea too, so now I know I don’t have to do it again. I don’t really have any ‘guilt’ around it, because I know it I what is needed to be done.
Going to try and relax now, my minds been thinking too much about food today (I hate this illness and it’s physical effect) so hopefully I’ll be able to relax a little now. 

I can’t be your idol because you are my idol.Seriously I love your singing, your journal and you’re an amazing chef!I’m so proud to be your friendLove you much 💛💛💛 

Need to take care of myself todaySo I’m cooking one of my favorites, pasta all'amatriciana. We all deserve to treat our bodies sometimes. 💖 

6/5/19im back and i feel like shit  !!!  i still weigh the same but im somehow bigger  :))))))  end me  !!!!!  



Body check!
It rained. I drank coffee and talked to my friends. Things were looking down before today. 
Still sad that my account @arizona20 got terminated but it’s okay. 
I’m feeling very sick. I had chest pains yesterday. I’ve been fasting for a few days. My migraines are back, I’m tired, and I’m weak. 
But I’m feeling decent about my body. Still no access to a scale. 
Stay safe and drink some water 💕
Feel free to repost or reblog💕 

everyone is freaking out over me smiling is probably the saddest realization ever. makes me realize how long I let myself suffer before being strong enough to ask for help. I was so taboo about antidepressants, worried that it would make me feel worse or lash out worse. But they have helped so so much. like I still cry ten times a day over trivial stuff, and I’m still struggling with my eating disorder, I still have triggering thoughts/urges. but this is the first time in eight years I decided this wasn’t how I’m going to live my life, not forever. No one wants to choose to stay alive when they feel that way every hour, or every day. it’s not easy to admit that you can’t recover on your own, but it is okay to admit it. even if you have to choke it out, even if you mumble it through tears. once you can admit it, it doesn’t need to control you as much as you have let it. I can’t even begin to explain the weight I felt come off of my chest once I talked about it. Yes, it was only a tiny bit of the weight I feel everyday, but it was a step towards recovery being possible. to being something I could actually do. it never felt truly possible. And that is awful to have to say, or to admit, but it is real, and it’s more common than you’d think. you don’t have to go through this alone. I am nowhere near recovery, I can admit that. I am still going days without eating, I am still punishing myself for binges, I am still in a war with the girl that I see in the mirror. But this doesn’t need to control my life this immensely. I guess the most important thing is to know that somewhere, with someone, you have a safe place to speak of what keeps you up at night, or struggled to make it through the chaos of life. it can get better. give yourself the chance to see it get better. thank you to anyone that actually took the time to read this. if you ever need someone to talk to, I am here. Any time, any day. You don’t have to go through this alone. 💛 

Hey! Thank you so much for having the courage to reach out about this. I’ve been in recovery for only a few months now and I know how hard it can be sometimes, and how defeated one can feel whenever there’s continued thoughts of relapsing. The thing you have to remember is that every time you overcome those thoughts you’re winning. Like, every time you don’t relapse, you’ve won. Every time you get back on track with recovery, you’re doing better than when you were living in your disorder.It’s also important to find a way to hold yourself accountable to recovering. For me, this blog has been a good way to do that, because I know that I’ve created a space where people are proud of how far I’ve come. It also means that I’ve opened up to my friends about my disorder and my recovery. In turn, my friends have been there to encourage me to go out to dinner with them or grab a snack when we’re hanging out. They’re not the force behind my recovery or anything, that has never been their responsibility, but they are a group that is reminding me that eating is okay, which is a small but very very important thing to have in your life. Recovery isn’t something without effort. It is an active movement to get better, to care for oneself, to be happy and fix your struggles with your mental health in whatever ways you can. It’s really fucking hard. And you aren’t weak for struggling. You aren’t weak for having bad days. In getting through those bad days, you’re helping yourself get stronger and helping your recovery to last. you got this. it will get easier. Hang in there. 



Because being skinny will not solve any of your problems, but being strong will.

Finally I had something with this meal, I had a lentil cottage pie but every time I’ve had it I haven’t had anything with it when it probably needs it. And I didn’t default to my usual safe broccoli and challenged having some peas! I know it’s not a huge portion but I started small as peas are quite a fear food for me (which is dumb because a few years ago they were the only veg I would eat!)
Myself and my parents (mainly Dad) talked and they have said that if I gain weight and get to a ‘certain point’ I can have a cat (or three🙈) and he’d buy me a car and a house and he’d do a bungee jump and all sorts if it would motivate me to get better, and idk I’ve had monetary motivations before but it hasn’t inspired me in the past, which I feel horribly ungrateful for being like that but I guess because I have my own money anyway? But the idea of having a cat, that really does inspire me, to potentially help an animal and also have another friend. It also really made me see how much my parents (especially Dad with regards these things) want me to get well, which is heartbreaking but makes me want to do it even more. Even though my parents and I argue, well, less so now, but we argue still, there is always ten thousand times more love than the love I feel around anorexia or the way anorexia makes me feel. I love them and if I can’t always do it for me, I will do it for them and potentially helping an animal and people in the future. 

If I get told I ‘starved my self for attention’ one more time… 

🙈
 

Strong Not SkinnyA new chain post I’ve created to spread healthiness to the ED community and to sufferers of body confidence/acceptance issues. Instead of posting thinspiration, I will be posting fitspo and healthy examples of strong beings as well as healthy meal ideas. You are free to request posts!! I may be posting about calories and weigh-ins(which won’t be very often I don’t think), but I will put a trigger warning at the beginning of those posts.Let’s recover together!! 💜💜

I really want to share this video with you guys. Please listen to her interview about her anorexia. When I watched her talking about her struggles and thoughts I just feel like it was myself telling someone about how I feel.
I almost had another panic attack before I watched this because of my intake and the whole weekend that’s behind me but now that I listened to this inspiring, lovely fighter I’m gaining hope and strength again.
We can all do this🦙✨

❌ being shitty to fat ppl because you “care about their health”👍🏻 recognizing that weight doesn’t necessarily correlate to health - you can be fat & healthy and you can be skinny & unhealthy🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 understanding that ppl deserve to be treated like human beings regardless of their health and other ppl’s health is literally none of your fucking business

to all men self-concious about their weight, please know that you don’t have to be a 6ft muscled guy with a beard who’s always angry/emotionless. being short/chubby/skinny/sad/emotional is okay, and you looked really handsome today 

This…doesnt seem like an emotionally healthy attitude 
So, a coworker of mine constantly likes and shares shit on Facebook from the “Mommy needs Vodka” group (which…I have a lot of feelings about the tacit acceptance of alcohol abuse through humor already) that just boil down to “I hate my body but I also like food I view as unhealthy. Arent I a mess? Haha so relatable.” 
Examples: 




Yall. 
This is not… a sustainable relationship with food or body image. Masking it as haha so relatable humor doesnt make it less toxic. 
This isnt the attitude of someone who has embraced body positivity and is living their best life and loving themselves regardless of artificial societal beauty standards. 
This is the attitude of people, of women, trying to mask pretty intense body image issues and guilt over foods they view as unhealthy with humor. This was how I dealt with my body image issues in high school and a good chunk of college- hiding from my guilt over food and my deep dislike for my weight with humor.
I hate it. I hate that it’s normalized. I hate that its seen as funny. Maybe I’m being overly sensitive about this to a degree because it reminds me so vividly of how I used to cope. But. Ack.
You shouldnt feel guilt about food. You shouldnt see food as the enemy of your body. You shouldnt fear or resent your body in a bikini.  

instagram.com/gabifresh 

your body cannot be wrong because there is no right way to have a body 

fall in love with yourself. swoon when you look in the mirror. hug your tummy and tell it how handsome it is. be inspired by the kindness you show. giggle at your own jokes. laugh at how cute and messy your hair looks in the morning. write poems about the way the sun reflets off your eyes, how the stretch marks on your thighs look like waves breaking on the shore, how your dimples mimict crators on the moon, how your smile emits the warmest glow. fall in love with yourself. you deserve it.

How to have a speedo-ready body in two easy steps:
1. Have a body
2. Have a speedo. 
Tadaaah 

ALRIGHT!I have had enough!I will not stand for these weight centric news years resolutions any longer!I will not stand by while hoards of beautiful, strong women and men are bullied and coerced into feeling shitty about their weight and make impossible news years resolutions to try and “fix it”Now don’t get me wrong, I believe everyone has a right to any decision they make about their bodyIf you wanna get twenty peircings, you get twenty piercingsIf you wanna use birth control, then you can use birth control If you wanna cover your body with a tattoo in the lyrics of Bohemian Rhapody, by all means, be my guestBut I just think that New Years resolutions have spent far too much time being all about losing weight and getting the “perfect body”Your body is perfect and beautiful because it’s your body It’s the first friend you ever had and it’s the last one that’ll be there in the endIt’s only job is to make sure that you keep going and it does it’s best So I’ve made a list of health improving, mentally stabilizing New Years resolutions that do not revolve around “I need to lose 50 pounds” or “I just have to get all this weight off this year”I would like to say that If you want to lose weight or gain weight because of a health issue or because you and your doctor agree it is what would benefit you physically, do not let me stand in your way but if you’re doing it because someone told you you’d look better if you just lost a few pounds or because you think you think that losing 20 pounds will finally make you happy, then hope you will please reconsiderWe are all beautiful, unique humans And our beauty is not defined by the size of our waist bands Originally posted by tampireNew Years Resolutions that don’t focus on weight but do focus on mental and physical healthRead More, enrich your brain and feed your mind, reading also lowers stress levelsEat more plant based things, you don’t have to go full vegetarian but eating less meat and more vegetables has been shown to make a huge difference in healthSleep more, your body needs rest to fix itself and growGo see a therapist, pay homage to your mental health this yearGet a mammogram or cancer screening Go get a regular check up this year Get your teeth cleaned Take up meditationStart doing regular breathing exercises Take up yoga or running or rock climbing, not because you think it’ll help you lose

retirement homeAdopt a shelter animal if you are financially secure enough to and fully ready to take on the responsibility of another lifeTake a multivitamin Reduce the amount you smoke or drink: special note on this one because I have had people who I’ve loved deal with smoking and drinking addiction and even though everyone tells you to just quit, decreasing the amount of your intake successfully is still progress and you should feel proud of that Reduce your sugar intake because sugar has been shown to have several negative effects of the body, not just weight Throw away all your

painting or knitting or cross stitchGo to a renisance fair Try a new restaurant Clean out your closet of clothes that don’t fit anymore, stop telling yourself that you can use them to motivate your self to lose weight Start keeping a journal Start a blogStart a new relationship if you are ready and have been dating someone you think is worth it Start a novelKeep a calendar Switch out your make up for cruelty free versionsStop eating diet foodsStop drinking diet drinksStop taking diet pillsJoin a gym because you want to and you think you could find out something new about yourself not

always been afraid to try Get a tattooGet a piercing Change your hair color Let go of a bad relationship Take an exciting gym class like pole dancing or kick boxing or scuba divingJoin a protest you believe in Redecorate your house Throw out all your old, holey underwear and socks and buy new onesCommit to self care sundaysThis list is just a few resolutions you could make instead of one completely about losing weight Take care of yourself guys and tell yourself “I am beautiful and I deserve a resolution that will bring me joy not stress”Happy New Years Originally posted by kid-with-plans 

i’ve been saying this to myself this morning and i’m going to say it to you in case you need to hear it: you are not here to be physically attractive. that is not your purpose. you are here to learn new things and be kind to people and listen to your favorite music and pet cute dogs and read big books and drink good coffee. you are here to see beauty in the world and create it when you can’t find any. you are not here to impress people with how you look.  

All food is guilt-free. There’s nothing shameful about feeding yourself, ever.

Don’t worry about tomorrow right now. Just close your eyes and get some rest. I know you’re anxious about what’s to come, but I promise you, it’s not as bad as your brain is telling you it is. You’re going to get through this. You are okay.

So, just some thoughts I’ve been having about fat-shaming and how others react to how you eat. So, recently,  my husband and I decided to try out Keto. (Which,  very briefly,  is when you cut carbs to a very very low level so your metabolism switches over to using fatty acids instead of glucose. It’s a pretty odd diet that has some specific benefits. Not for everyone, but useful for some) Its basically cured my migraines; I havent had a single one since I started. Its helped my energy levels. And yes, I’ve been losing some weight as well. And so far, everyone I know in real life has been very supportive if I explain to them why I cant have a cookie in the breakroom, or why ordering lunch at a resteraunt is taking me so long (gotta check those net carbs online!!) But I’m also on the Keto subreddit right now.  And people tell these awful stories all the time about friends, family, coworkers, even fucking waiters, being rude or judgemental when their keto comes up. Fights with famil  over their diet. Having to lie to waiters about having a food allergy or they get scoffed at for asking about the nutritional info or ingredients.  Most of these folks also started with a lot more weight to lose than me (I started at right about 200lbs, closer to 190 now after about a month. A lot of these folks with the worst experiences talk about starting at close to or over 300)Now, I don’t think I’m just magically lucky in my coworkers and waitstaff. I would wager that this comes down to the extreme hostility that people throw at EVERYTHING fat people do. This mentality that if you “ let yourself ” get that heavy, everything you try must be bad.Look, I’m chubby. I have some weight I can stand lose, sure. It’s not really a health issue for me at the moment, but losing a little weight and working out more is helping me get into better shape for backpacking and hiking. If you saw me on the street, you might think “plump” but not obese. And when I say “oh, no croutons in my salad please, I can’t eat them.” Or “no thanks, I can’t have the sugar right now” people smile and maybe apologize. Very nice. Very polite. If I havent told them about the keto, maybe they assume I have a gluten allergy or I’m diabetic or its a health thing. No one’s ever been mean about it. But these folks who do have more weight to lose, who are working really hard to meet their personal goals, tell these stories of people giving them hell over it. Because when you’re fat, you can’t do anything right, everything is on the table to critisism,  nothing is ever good enough. It’s awful.  And its an obvious difference that even I experience,  and I’m no magazine model. THIS is “thin privilege”. Once you can be labeled “obese” society has decided that you’re fair game for any level of rudeness. So, a general reminder: dont be an asshole, especially about other peoples food, weight, or diet. You aren’t their doctor. Don’t be a dick.  

you do you! <3333

PREACH.  

I was thinking about somethings that help me take care of my mental health and there’s this one thing I started when I was feeling a little depressed and useless a while ago and if it helps one single person as much as it helped me, then I’m glad. The thing is to write down every single accomplishments of your day. In the beginning I felt really stupid and didn’t know what to write but then I realized that we have a lot of them (accomplishments) daily. So, by the second week I was writing stuff like:woke up before 10 ammade my bedput the perfect amount of sugar in my coffeeused all the rooms in my housetook a minute to appreciate sunlightwasn’t rude to someone I usually amfinished a booksaid hi to the bus driverdanced to a songate a whole mealdressed nicespent a while away from my phonestudied for and entire hour without interruptionsdidn’t bite my nailsgave the right answer on a difficult subject (even if all the others were wrong)these little everyday accomplishments made me feel like maybe I’m not useless, because, believe me, we all deserve to be here and we all deserve to be happy. And I’m no psychologist but I truly believe that the main reason for us to be on earth is to help each other on this journey we call life. be patient with yourself

Trans guys who aren’t on T yet and still won’t be on T for a while because they can’t come out?? Still handsome and masculine as hell. Your time will come just hang on til then .[pls don’t derail this post. I’m talking abt a specific group of people.] 

Music Spotlight: Glowiein this week’s Music Spotlight, we’re featuring 21-year old Icelandic native, Glowie (@glowieofficial), who’s both a singer and trained dancer. Right now, she’s taking her R&B-leaning pop style to create music that reflects her past of bullying and speaks to body positivity. We talked to her about her passion for helping people, advice on self-love and her fear of the ocean.1) Give us a 2-3 sentences on something you are extremely passionate about.I’m really passionate about helping people, when I see someone struggling I really can’t leave it alone I always need to do something. I’m that annoying person who never tells you what you want to hear but what you need to hear. I’m always looking forward and thinking in solutions, what can I do to make things better.2) What is the message you are trying to convey through your newest song, “Body”?‘Body’ is about feeling free and confidant, it’s about giving yourself compliments and not really care what anybody else thinks. It’s about feeling happy with who you really are and not having to hide or pretend, you can be carefree and believe you can do anything.3) What kind of advice can you give to those struggling with body image? Find the real reason why you feel insecure with your body, find the bottom line, where does this feeling really come from. I’m sure you’ll find that it comes from what you’ve seen and heard from other people, in magazines, on TV…. and you’re comparing yourself to that which is totally normal. But you have to be able to take all of that to the side and not let it affect how you feel about yourself and really look in the mirror and find your confidence. Confidence and self love is important and no one can give it to you, you have to find it yourself.  4) What’s one thing that scares you and one thing that excites you? Why? I’m scared of the ocean and the waves, I’m scared of being in it or near it. I don’t know why but I think It might be because it’s so big and the waves are so strong and there are so many creatures down there that we don’t know, I guess it’s a fear of not knowing what’s there or what’s coming. The thing that excites me the most is being at a concert, I’ve only been to a few but it’s always the same feeling every time. Watching a show and watching someone performing they’re art, the music is so loud you can feel the bass vibrating in your brain, everyone is just lost in the moment enjoying the music.Interested to hear more?

Hufflepuff: I may not have the best body but it sure does hold all my organs in place. 

Aidy Bryant On ‘Shrill,’ 'SNL’ Thrills, And Not Feeling Bad About Her BodyAidy Bryant mourns the time she lost in her teens and early 20s feeling self-conscious about her body. The Emmy-nominated comic and actor says she lived in fear of judgments about her weight.“I felt like the worst possible thing that anyone could ever do would be to think that I was fat, to call me fat,” she says.Bryant began to direct her energy into her writing and comedy career. She moved to Chicago to pursue comedy at Second City, and in 2012, became a cast member on Saturday Night Live.Bryant is still on SNL, and now also stars in the Hulu comedy series Shrill, based on Lindy West’s 2016 memoir. The series centers on a young writer named Annie who is described as a “woman who wants to change her life — but not her body.”It’s a perspective that strikes a chord with Bryant. Looking back now, she says, “the second I stopped being afraid of someone calling me fat, I was able to start to focus on my goals and my dreams.”

ଘ(੭ˊ꒳ˋ)੭✧ i believe in you! 

Your body loves you. It’s only job is to keep you alive and it is so dedicated to doing so. It fights to keep you alive and healthy and safe. As long as you’re still breathing, remember that your body still loves you. So maybe it’s time to start loving your body back. 

I’d be happy to explain!1) If you read my explanation below the image *cough cough* you’ll see that she was a bit of a random choice. I could have picked any lady to be in her place, eg. a mage who you could argue doesn’t work out as much. I just thought Sumia looked cute a little chubby <32) I don’t think she is “fat” to be honest! She just doesn’t have a flat stomach, like almost all women! I based her body type on pictures I could find of the statistically average American woman. It’s a bit ridiculous that women without flat, toned stomachs are never ever shown in video games as main characters and it’s important for people to have positive representation! This article was an inspiration.3) So as a Pegasus rider, you’d want to have as little weight as possible, no? So she must be skinny? Well actually, it turns out it’s a fantasy game and Pegasus don’t actually exist! Her Pegasus was able to carry Sumia and Chrom in the game and still fly, so why would an extra 10-20 pounds be an issue? Is is really too far-fetched for a non-flat stomached woman to be able to ride an imaginary flying horse in a fantasy game with magic and dragons? And besides… if you’re worried about realism in Fire Emblem games you must absolutely hate Camilla’s boobs being out in her armour, right? Her vital organs are exposed! The very thing armour has been worn throughout all human history to protect! Because if not, maybe it was never realism you were concerned about? 

It be like that sometimes

On writing “My Skin,” her first body positive song

“Someone asked a question. … They asked me what’s my favorite thing about myself? And I told them my personality. And they said, “OK, but physically, what’s your favorite thing about yourself?” And I did not have an answer.For the first time in my life I had to actually think about something that I liked about myself physically, and because it was so difficult, I was moved to tears.In that moment, I remembered that I’d just fallen off a cliff. … I was rope swinging into the river, and I am just so heavy, and I fell off the rope and fell on the ground. It was really scary and traumatizing. I’ll never do anything like that again, but I scraped up my skin and I remember my friend was like, “Look what you did to your beautiful skin!”I still had the cane and I had the bandages on my legs during this interview. And I looked down and I was like, “Oh, my God. My skin. That is my favorite thing about myself.” And it was in that moment where I realized I damaged my skin where I saw the value in it. That was the first time I’d ever discovered my body love, and I just started with my skin and moved on from there. I wrote this song to celebrate that moment because it literally changed my life.The thing that I like about myself the most is the thing that’s weaponized against us. People with black skin, you know, we get that weaponized, and this was [during] the beginning of #BlackLivesMatter, when there was such a public amount of executions of unarmed black people by police officers. And so, I think that it was almost oxymoronic to be like, “I love my black skin,” when that was the thing that’s held against me the most in this society. I wanted to write a song about that too, and talk about how I’m proud of it no matter what.”On how her wearing sexy clothing is seen as a feminist statement“I feel like if I were a thin woman, maybe that wouldn’t be the case. I feel like women who are smaller aren’t really given the opportunities to be body positive or role models either, because we’ve been conditioned to believe that women are using their bodies for the male gaze. … And I think if I were slimmer I don’t think people would look to me with the same type of like, “Oh wow, she’s so brave she’s doing this and representing everyone!” [the way they do,] because I’m big.”Read the full piece and listen to the interview here 

The holiday season can be a very difficult time when it comes to nutrition. With so many delicious treats and traditions around food, many people find themselves indulging in more ‘unhealthy’ foods than they usually would, and this can be accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt and sadness. Here’s a few ‘Do’s and Don’ts’ for supporting your physical and mental health this holiday season. Do:-Enjoy your favourite holiday treats!As we all know, food is an important part of our holiday celebrations! Allow yourself to enjoy these tasty once-a-year treats. Completely restricting yourself from eating your favourite foods is likely to make you feel deprived, and may contribute to binge-eating around the holidays. -Think about ‘Food Value’Some foods don’t have great nutritional value, but can have value because they make us feel good, or are part of an important holiday tradition. So during the holidays, when confronted with a potentially unhealthy food choice, try asking yourself ‘Is it worth it?’If it’s one of your mom’s homemade gingerbread cookies that you’ve been looking forward to all year, then the answer is probably YES! If it’s your neighbour’s not-so-special fruitcake, then maybe it’s okay to turn it down. -Fit in some healthy foodsWhen holidays parties and celebrations run on for weeks, it can wind up being a long time since your last serving of veggies! Try to make an effort to fit in some healthy meals between festivities when you can. -Make time for physical activityThe holidays are a busy time, but try to fit in some exercise when you can! This could mean going to the gym, or it could be as simple as taking the stairs at work, or parking at the far-end of the parking lot when going shopping-Set boundaries with family and friendsThere can be a lot of talk about weight, diets, and New Year’s resolutions during the holidays. It’s okay to set boundaries with family and friends about not talking about these things around you. Protect your mental health!Don’t:-Skip meals to ‘make up’ for holiday indulgencesSkipping meals in preparation for a big event, or not eating afterwards to ‘make up’ for over-indulging is NOT a good idea. This behaviour can contribute to binge-eating patterns, as well as the guilt/dieting cycle. Instead, try to leave the guilt behind, and get back to your healthy habits as soon as you’re ready.-Exercise to ‘burn off’ what you atePhysical activity can be a fun and joyful part of the holidays. It’s awesome to get outside for a walk, play in the snow, go skiing, or simply go to the gym if that’s your jam. But please don’t force yourself to spend hours trying to burn off calories from holiday treats. Just enjoy the holidays, leave the guilt behind, and get back to your healthy habits as soon as you can.-Beat yourself upTrying to say no to everything unhealthy during the holidays is very likely to result in disappointment. Enjoy your holiday treats, turn down the things that aren’t so appealing, and eat however much of each treat you need to feel satisfied. Also remember to take care of your mental health at this sometimes-stressful time of year!And most importantly, have a very happy holiday season!

Ron played by the most handsome @pleb-petal-potterInspired by this beautiful art here by @mad1492Hermione: Morning, RonLet’s normalize something right now. Stretch marks. I can’t get the years back when I gained weight, got stretch marks, thought my bod was ruined and Never Wore Shorts Or A Swimsuit Again, but that’s honestly aright. Because I’m an adult woman now, and I can, and will do all of those things, and look just fine doing it because stretch marks are normal for Christ sake.We only have mass media being very irresponsible, and telling us otherwise. It’s insane. You aren’t ruined. You’re beautiful. God damn I wish I could tell my younger self that.The person who would get on their knees and trace over them with their fingers, that’s the person I’d want to be with. Not someone where i’m pretending I don’t have them, or have to feel ashamed. Not even the person who’d simply “ignore” them. But the person who would actively worship them, and find real sacred beauty in my very real, adult woman body.

“diet culture is so rooted in the idea that our bodies are machines that our minds have to outwit. it pushes for the idea that hunger is something you have to “beat”, that cravings are an annoyance to ignore or outwit, that the way our bodies want to look and want to be is something to fight, that it needs to be helped to do things it was built to do. 
here is the liberating truth - your body is so smart and it is trying to help you. it works so hard to keep you alive - sometimes it fails at what it’s trying to do, sometimes it does it in unconvential ways, but it is trying to keep you alive! hunger is our body saying “we need food”- it’s not something to ignore or supress. cravings are our body saying “we need a specific type of food”- they aren’t something to trick or prevent. natural weight and weight distribution are our body saying “this is the shape in which we work best”- they aren’t something to control or reduce. denying this is what hurts us most- even though diet culture tries to tell us that listening to our bodies and treating them with kindness and forgiveness is wrong” @bioethicists

It’s almost 2019 and nonbinary men are still absolutely gorgeous wow. Perfect. Amazing. Spectacular. 
Hot take but girls who have a yellow aesthetic and play ukulele, keep succulents in their room and talk about saving the bees aren’t “cringy” They’re just happy or trying to be happy. You guys are just assholes.   
a big part of being happy is being excited. be excited for everything - making a cup of tea, decorating your future apartment, seeing a friend again, falling in love unexpectedly, the next episode of a show you like,  finishing something stressful, buying something you’ve been saving up for, a new album, sunsets, traveling, road trips, and the feeling of going to bed after a long day. think of something to be excited about and daydream about it often when you’re sad. 
You can’t expect yourself to go from a negative mentality to a positive one overnight, but every time you correct a bad thought you are growing! So focus on your growth, not the fact that you aren’t “there” yet.  
A threat 
 
you’re allowed to have emotions that aren’t positive!!! you’re allowed to feel angry or jealous or sad or frustrated or annoyed. emotions are normal and healthy, but it’s up to you to decide what to do with them. 
small ways to be a better person ✨wait for someone if u notice they’re falling behindif you have a moment of admiration or love for someone, say it out loud give random song recs and send them things that made u think of them be as kind to yourself as you are to others be more aware of your surroundings and help people who seem to need help if someone gets interrupted, ask what they were going to say try to step inside someone’s shoes instead of judging them or labeling themdon’t say hurtful things especially if it’s not constructive say “I love you” more often and spend more time with people you love make sure everyone in the group is includedmake someone’s day better by smiling at everyone you see and maybe saying hello ask if someone is okay if you notice that they’ve been distant  
look not to spoil the ending but you’re going to recover and be happy  

you are more than your abuse

how to handle 1 emotion at a time (2018) 

Go! Be kind to yourself, take care of your body! <3 

a gentle reminder that healing takes time. you need to be patient with yourself with the process. forgive yourself when you relapse into old behaviours. encourage yourself to get out of bed, avoid harmful ways to cope and suggest a healthy coping mechanism, as if a friend was encouraging you. remind yourself to drink water, to eat fruits, journal, stop dwelling on things that don’t matter anymore, and see everything good in the world. it takes time and you’re in pain but you’re trying, and you’re alive and growing a little every day, and that’s all that counts. 

You are blooming. Please give yourself time.  

facts, ladies & gentlemen  

it’s never too late. go after what you want! it doesn’t matter if you’re 15 or 25 or 65. there’s no deadline or fixed schedule you need to follow. starting over or starting late is okay! go at your own pace!  

In case you forgot:You’re allowed to make mistakesYou’re allowed to get things wrongYour past does not define you if you choose to grow from it 

Don’t belittle your achievements. Stop using words like “just” or “only” when you’re talking about things you did. It’s okay to be proud. You should be. 

The common thread in recovery stories is that people never thought in a million years that things could get so much better, but they did. It’s difficult to imagine yourself at the top of that mountain when you’re lying at the shadows at the bottom of it. But it’s possible. People do it all the time, and you can too.  

hey, can you stop for a second, please?inhale for menow, exhaletake a moment to reorient yourself - have you had something to drink? have you had food? have you taken your medications, if you need to? maybe it is time to have a shower and change your clothes, toothis is your reminder to breathe and take care of yourself, please. you got this. 

Many Brazilians wept after their 200-year-old National Museum was destroyed in a devastating fire last September. Twenty million objects, many of them irreplaceable, were thought to have been lost. But eight months later, staff have salvaged more treasures than they expected, and there are hopes that one of the great museums of the world can be brought back to life.Suddenly, a shout echoes round the blackened, roofless shell of the once-elegant room.A tall young man in white helmet and black gloves is standing triumphantly on a pile of smashed tiles and plaster. Cradled in his palm is a small piece of carved stone with ancient hieroglyphics.Continue reading 

 

the world can be so beautiful. somewhere, a baby was a born. someone got their first kiss. someone beat cancer. someone got married. someone adopted a lonely cat. someone is loving themself. someone got approved for life-saving surgery. flowers are blooming, the sun is shining, the moon is out there. if you can’t find anything beautiful, make it.  

My biggest goal in life is to be the kind of person that people feel comfortable talking about their hyperfixations and special interests with. If you’re really passionate about something, I think that’s amazing, and I want to hear more about what you love! I never want people to think that I’m annoyed or disinterested when they’re excitedly discussing something that means a lot to them. Please don’t ever apologize for “rambling” to me, because it breaks my heart to see people who are super apologetic about speaking openly about what they enjoy. I love your passion and your vigor, so don’t ever change.  

 

You have purpose. You are important. You are so needed on this earth. Please don’t ever give up. You are such a light. 

It might feel like you’re just surviving right now, but one day you’ll be living, you’ll be thriving, and that day is worth surviving for.  

here’s a little something my therapist told me that helped me out:even people with the worst trauma tell themselves “it could have been worse”even people with the most unpreventable trauma blame themselves.every single person who has gone through trauma beats themself up over it.those thoughts that you shouldve done something different or that you just need to “get over it”… they aren’t true. they’re just symptoms of real, valid trauma. what you went through was hard. no human being deserves to go through that. you are allowed to be upset. you are allowed to feel angry and scared. your feelings are valid, and it was not your fault. 

Daily reminders 

Growth is possible. Change is possible. Reinvention is possible. 

 

it is! x 

eating dis*rders never really leave you. they just stay dormant for awhile before surprising you unexpectedly with either the biggest binge or the wild idea to restrict again. it never truly stops. 

It can happen to all of us. 

you are not the lies you tell yourselfyou are not uglyyou are not annoyingyou are not unloveableyou are not worthlesshowever…you are beautifulyou are unique you are loved by so many peopleyou have so much worth 

Why are you so hard on yourself? You’re doing the best that you can.  

slow progress is still progress

destroy the disorder, not yourself 

Eating disorders don’t just change the way you think about food. They change the way you think about every single thing. Everything. 

Please try to stop doubting yourself. Truly. Be confident in the person whom you are becoming.  





some day 

If you are a person… of colorwith a disabilitywith a mental illnesswho identifies as lgbtqia+who is fatwho is a member of any oppressed group…every act of self-care is a radical political statement. In a world that treats you as less than, treat yourself as worthy of care and compassion. It’s not selfish - in fact, just the opposite. Your self-care creates a better world. 

it’s difficult to believe sometimes but:- your trauma isn’t “not bad enough”- you aren’t “faking it”- you deserve to recover 

 

-dogs you see-times you smile-leaves on a flower-friends who want you to be happy-tasty things you enjoy eating during the day 

Yes, sure, my trauma affected me. Do you know what else affected me? Dancing under the glow of LED strip lights with my best friend at 3am. The pair of shoes my godmother gave me with the cute little bows that I wear for good luck. My girlfriend laughing so hard at my joke she had tears on her face. The hours and hours I’ve spent scribbling in the margins of books. Buying the ugliest sweater at goodwill because it made all my friends grin. Listening to that song on repeat while I swayed through the halls at school, smiling in response to all the weird looks people sent me.I’m never going to just be the bad parts. I refuse to be boiled down to just the bad parts. Every moment of my life has affected me in some way, more than even just the parts I remember, and there has been beauty contained within and surrounding all the grotesquities.  

It’s okay to feel tired. Take yourself to bed at 9pm, and tuck yourself in like the cute burrito you are. Tomorrow is new and full of opportunities.  

I know that sometimes ‘it gets better’ can feel like an empty platitude, but the reason it’s such a cliché is because it happens so often. So many people have been where you are now, and thought that it would never get better, and it did. And that can happen for you too.  

Mood. This is @incendaverys work. Give them a follow if you like this content! ❤️ 

Look back at your past selves. Give them a smile. They have helped you become who you are today. Nicole Addison @thepowerwithin  

In case your mom/dad doesn’t say it, I want you to know that I’m proud of you. I think that thing you’re doing Is awesome and I am stoked to see the amazing talented person you’re growing into. I love you kiddo 

Having a bad day, having a relapse, slipping back into a bad habit, making a mistake, none of these things erase the progress you’ve made so far. You’ve done well before and you can do well again. All of the strides in the right direction that you’ve made don’t disappear just because you tripped over on your path. Get back up, keep walking, you can do it.

Daily #2,185! One step. All you have to do today is take one step.  

No one around me knows how bad I’m struggling right now.  

if you kept fighting your battles today, i’m proud of you  

who you are is enough. repeat it again and again. you are enough. 

Did you know that when you eat enough food every day your mood is improved, your body doesn’t hurt, and you have the energy to accomplish tasks throughout the day? What a wild, novel concept. 

i feel like this is gonna upset some people but i have to say it. i struggled very severely with mental heath issues for most of my life and im not obliged to anyone to give more details than that but do you know what finally helped me into recovery after years of toxic cycles? i had a therapist who, every time i started going on a rant that seemed to be victimising myself or looking for sympathy, she’d stop me and say “what are you looking for from me? what do you want me to say?” she’d call out my own desperate seeking for validation and sympathy and she cut those coping mechanisms right out of me eventually. and i hated her. i really did. i thought why are you trying to stop me from looking for sympathy?im struggling? but what i’ve realised in hindsight is that in that mindset of self victimisation you can never recover because youre holding yourself down and wallowing in your pain because you think you need it to appeal to others.youre missing something and youre substituting it by being able to make people pity you. and im not saying dont share your pain with others because thats a vital part of recovery too but think what your motives are.dont go into a victim mindset at the first sign of trouble because that puts you in a position without power over yourself and your situation! i thought id never be able to recover whilst still being in a toxic household and yet i did because i stopped making myself the victim. yes allow your pain, yes acknowledge your feelings and say that theyre warranted and deserved, but stop seeing your position as a place thats impossible to get out of. posting all these self deprecating memes and deeply personal posts to share to the masses… question your motives. is this harming me? is this normalising my own suffering?is this integrating my illness INTO my personality in a way which makes me think i cant live without it? are my posts harming others? question your oversharing, find the validation youre seeking in yourself not in others. 

The love that you have for yourself might be one of the hardest of loves to develop. But you must. You must be able to appreciate all that you are.Nicole Addison @thepowerwithin

Some days are tougher and all you can do is take a deep breath. But that’s okay, you are doing your best. 

It doesn’t matter where you go; if your mind is not at peace, you will not be at peace.Nicole Addison @thepowerwithin  

Nobody: Me: CLIMATE! CHANGE! IS! REAL! STOP! USING! SO! MUCH! PLASTIC! 

Friendly reminder:You are allowed to ask for help.You are not weak for needing help.You are not a burden for asking for help.You are not annoying or a bother for asking for help.Everyone needs help sometimes.It’s okay to ask for help.It’s okay to need reassurance and support, and it’s okay to request that. You deserve to have your needs listened to and respected. You don’t need to do this alone.

Aaahhh 💕💕💕💕💕💕Have some wholesome AND supportive doodle~Inspired on this: 
It doesn’t make you unlovable or a horrible person if you don’t have many friends. It can be difficult to meet new people if you’re shy or quiet or have anxiety. It can be difficult to stay in touch with people if you can’t find the time or energy to remain in contact. It can be difficult to make new friends if you struggle to find people you click with or who are interested in the same things as you. None of those things mean you’re unlovable.  
hoppy tdov 🐸 click it!  
Friendly reminder: when people say ‘as long as you tried your best’ it doesn’t mean ‘the best you could possibly have done ever’ it means ‘the best you were capable of at the time.’ Sometimes ‘trying your best’ is just getting out of bed in the morning. Just because you weren’t working yourself to the bone doesn’t mean you weren’t trying your best.

Hot take but girls who have a yellow aesthetic and play ukulele, keep succulents in their room and talk about saving the bees aren’t “cringy” They’re just happy or trying to be happy. You guys are just assholes.

Robert Pattinson’s casting as Batman
I think he’s perfect for the role, but if you don’t, just shut the fuck up about his body.
He’s had body issues forever since he was being constantly picked-apart by Twilight fans. Here’s a quote from one of his interviews:
“Body dysmorphia, overall tremendous anxiety. I suppose it’s because of these tremendous insecurities that I never found a way to become egotistical. I don’t have a six-pack and I hate going to the gym. I’ve been like that my whole life. I never want to take my shirt off. I’d prefer to get drunk.”
He has also said that he was never even going to try to get a six pack. And yet.
Over the past year, Robert has been spotted working out religiously. He’s doing what he hates most, what gives him horrible anxiety, all for a role he’s probably always dreamed of. And you people are still out here trying to verbally abuse him and critique his appearance. It’s like 2007 all over again.
If you honestly think he’s not a good choice, fine, but leave his body out of it. Body-shaming men is just as bad as body-shaming women and it’s just fucked up that he has to go through all this all over again.

in case you needed a reminder, because we all do sometimes: you are doing your best. you do not need to be perfect. you do not need to meet some unobtainable standard. you just need to be you. you are enough just as you are.

me, thinking about trans women and all they have done for the lgbt community: 

it’s never too late. go after what you want! it doesn’t matter if you’re 15 or 25 or 65. there’s no deadline or fixed schedule you need to follow. starting over or starting late is okay! go at your own pace!

Gentle reminder that the brain gets used to intense stimuli over time and that it tends to seek out things that make you feel bad again once you’re in a better placeSo if you’re suffering from trauma, abuse or depression then don’t beat yourself up about wanting to feel bad again and seeking out triggers or abuse. It’s not because you deserve any of that, it’s because your brain was exposed to bad things for so long that it can’t make sense of how you’re doing now. We’ve all been there. It’s going to be okay. You can do this. 

The common thread in recovery stories is that people never thought in a million years that things could get so much better, but they did. It’s difficult to imagine yourself at the top of that mountain when you’re lying at the shadows at the bottom of it. But it’s possible. People do it all the time, and you can too.  

We’re all just lizards with anxiety doing our best ✨ 

hey, can you stop for a second, please?inhale for menow, exhaletake a moment to reorient yourself - have you had something to drink? have you had food? have you taken your medications, if you need to? maybe it is time to have a shower and change your clothes, toothis is your reminder to breathe and take care of yourself, please. you got this.

No matter how many times you fail to meet your own expectations, you have to forgive yourself. Despite contrary belief, dwelling on and badgering yourself over your faults doesn’t ever help you grow into who you want to be.It’s like gardening: if your flower isn’t blossoming like you want it to, you don’t rip out its leaves as punishment for failing to satisfy you. You recognize the problem and  figure out what’s going wrong with its environment so you can modify it, giving the flower a chance to bloom in its own time.Accept your shortcoming or setback, forgive yourself, and figure out what’s going wrong so that you can plan for how to prevent it from repeating in the future. Thank your past self for trying in the first place and then give your future self the love needed to flourish.  

healing is worth it, you deserve to get better, you are brave for even considering it, I am so proud of you for waking up this morning  

 

the world can be so beautiful. somewhere, a baby was a born. someone got their first kiss. someone beat cancer. someone got married. someone adopted a lonely cat. someone is loving themself. someone got approved for life-saving surgery. flowers are blooming, the sun is shining, the moon is out there. if you can’t find anything beautiful, make it.  

You have purpose. You are important. You are so needed on this earth. Please don’t ever give up. You are such a light.

you are not the lies you tell yourselfyou are not uglyyou are not annoyingyou are not unloveableyou are not worthlesshowever…you are beautifulyou are unique you are loved by so many peopleyou have so much worth 

Goal is to: try to practice a peaceful and positive life. Try not to judge people about their decisions in life, try to spread love to everyone you meet, smile and respect your friends and colleagues, your neighbors and your relatives. Try not to talk behind people’s back. Try to be happy and content. 

stop scrolling for just a second and take a few nice, deep breaths. things will be okay.everything will sort itself out eventually.hang in there.i hope you have a great rest of your day, friend. 

 

When someone makes you the happiest person and the saddest person at the same time, that’s when it’s real. That’s when it’s worth something. 

You do not have to apologise for existing.You do not have to apologise for having needs. 

Friendly reminder that you’re allowed to have bad days. you’re allowed to cry. you’re allowed to feel your feelings, and remind yourself that a bad day, or having bad feelings wont last forever. you will be okay. i promise.

slow progress is still progress 

If someone has mistreated you, it isn’t because you deserved it. You didn’t deserve to be abused or manipulated or abandoned or lied to. You didn’t bring this upon yourself. You are not to blame for someone else’s actions.  

If you messed up today…It’s okay. Everyone in the world messes up, and no matter what that voice in your head is saying, you haven’t messed up worse than anyone else in history. It’s okay. Just keep moving. Keep going.Hang in there.  

In case you haven’t heard it lately and need to:
You deserve to be happy.
In spite of anything you may be going through right now, whatever situation you may be stuck in, no matter how hopeless things seem, regardless of anyone or anything (yourself included) telling you otherwise, you are worthy of happiness.
You’re allowed your negative feelings. You’re allowed anger and sorrow and grief and fear and loneliness and hopelessness. You’re allowed to be upset towards any circumstances of yours you deem unfair and painful.
But please, alongside and beyond all of that, remember that you are allowed to find happiness, too. They’re not mutually exclusive, odd as it may seem.
It might not be big, it might not be always, but I promise you.
You deserve to be happy.

Hey writers, this is your casual reminder that there is no shame in being self-indulgent and writing what you want to write!If you want to write a superhero vs giant robots story taking place in outer space, that’s totally okay! If you want to write unhappy endings it’s 100% valid.If you want to write a certain part of your WIP that you’re not at yet right now you can do that too! If you want to go off and explore something that’s not immediately relevant to your project, that’s fine and valid.Give yourself permission to write what you like, and to have a lot of fun with it! 

I found this and I love it so much. Compassion is so underrated these days. Spread kindness and be kind.✨ 

 

it’s difficult to believe sometimes but:- your trauma isn’t “not bad enough”- you aren’t “faking it”- you deserve to recover 

If you needed to hear this today:You are appreciated.You are loved.You are gorgeous.You are smart.You will get through this.You are strong.You are worthy of everything you put your mind into.You are damn perfect just the way you are.You can and you will, because you’re that badass.Keep going. I love you.

Treat disabled people with respect 

Crowcore? Goblincore? Dragoncore? Cottagecore? Grandmacore? Naturecore? Yes to all, I love them and identify with all of them. Love that shit. Get those shinies, bake the bread, get a rustic cottage in the country and live away from humanity. All perfect. Fucking superb. 

you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being alive. you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being here. you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being loved. there are no terms and conditions to your right to exist. 

One of the best feelings ever.  

let it go. 

I know that sometimes ‘it gets better’ can feel like an empty platitude, but the reason it’s such a cliché is because it happens so often. So many people have been where you are now, and thought that it would never get better, and it did. And that can happen for you too.  

You made it, you did it again; you pushed through today, no matter how rough it was. You are such a warrior. Good job, my love, I am so proud of you.

Having a bad day, having a relapse, slipping back into a bad habit, making a mistake, none of these things erase the progress you’ve made so far. You’ve done well before and you can do well again. All of the strides in the right direction that you’ve made don’t disappear just because you tripped over on your path. Get back up, keep walking, you can do it.  

you’re good. you’re so so so so so so good. you’re doing so much good for the world. for others. for yourself. taking responsibility for your mistakes. putting in the effort to grow. you’re so good. go you. 

 

You matter. Your existence has made a difference. Even the tiniest things, the things you won’t even remember, like complimenting a friend, holding a door open for someone, smiling at a child. Those tiny acts of kindness might just be little glimmers by themselves, but when you add them up, your impact on the world shines. So keep shining.   

It’s going to be ok, my ouija board told me so. 

you are not being mean by standing up for yourself. you are not being mean by demanding respect. you are not being mean by advocating for your own needs. stop feeling ashamed and apologising for being your own advocate when necessary.

Trans guys dont need to bind in order to be 100% guys and 100% handsome. Doesn’t matter what your reasons are for not binding. You’re still a man and you’re still awesome as fuck :/  

 

Never force anything. Don’t worry. If it’s meant to be in your life it will be.  

If anyone has ever told you that you weren’t good enough to be loved or respected, that you were unlovable, or inferior, or that you would never succeed, they were lying to you. You will find people who love you for who you are. You are deserving of love and respect and kindness. You are important, you are valuable. Go prove those lying bastards wrong by being true to yourself, being unapologetic and unashamed, and being the wonderful, unique, loved person that you are.

How long has it been there?)Piles of crap around the bin you’re too lazy to emptyNot taking your break when the timer goes off because you got into a rhythm and then immediately losing all motivation as soon as you set a second timerGiving yourself a day off and then forgetting how to studyQuick, 2 minute power cries in between revision when it just gets too muchAesthetic notes that mean you get pen all over your handsSmall bits of paper with scribbles on for testing pens or gluing bits of paperSo.

Gentle reminder that it’s okay to take your time and go slow. Don’t rush, even if other people tell you to do so. 

⛅ Kindness ⛅ 

You know what?  It really is good for your soul to go outside every now and then and just. SIT. And not listen to music or read or talk or walk.  Just you, all alone, listening and watching.  At first you will be fidgety and bored but the longer you sit there the more you will notice, about your surroundings and yourself.

Try not to believe the lies being told to you by your mental illness.You are not unlovable or undeserving of love.The world and the people in it would not be better off without you.It’s not going to be like this forever.You are valuable, and that value is inherent to you as a person - it’s not about how much you can contribute or what you can do.You are not a burden.You are not worthless.You don’t have to compare yourself to others.Making one mistake is not the end of the world, nor does it change any of the above things.There is nothing wrong with being true to yourself, because the authentic you that you are is beautiful and worthwhile.I know it can be hard. But please try to remind yourself of these things every so often. You don’t have to accept what the bad thoughts say as fact, because they’re lying to you. 

Live your best life

to-do list: marchgo on more walks. put the phone in your pocket - take a scarf if necessary - and just go a few blocks down, without a destination in mind. observe the architecture, the people, the atmosphere. let yourself dive into your thoughts.do not be afraid to get help. if you think you need someone to get you out of a dark place, reach out to them, or anyone. they will listen and understand.keep the things that are important to you. it’s good to let go of certain things that are toxic or put you down; but if you think something is worth keeping, don’t let go of it. have enough strength to resist the urge to give up.work on your communication. try to get your points across as clearly as possible. don’t circumvent important things that need to be addressed but you’re uncomfortable talking about. understandability is crucial.remind yourself that people love you. there are people who think about you and smile, who can be themselves around you. you’re an important person in so many people’s lives. you’re not alone. you really aren’t. 

for ur daily recommended dose of positivity, here is a list of Good Things™:that feeling of accomplishment when a random cat on the street lets u pet itfinding a great new daydream sequencesunsets where the clouds r stunningly bright colorslaughing so hard u cryseein someone cute and feelin ur heart go lub dubfuzzy bumble bees bumping into thingswaking up at 3am and realizing u get to go back to sleepppl telling u they missed uwalking on a slippery floor in fuzzy socksthe warm breeze and dark sky and smell of rain right before a thunderstormmusic that makes u feel thingsstars (!!!!!) 

its okay to be upset and cry ur eyes out, even if its over something little. u aren’t weak at all. you are still strong as fuck. you will get over this and feel good again, and that will make you even stronger than before. i believe in u <3 

If you don’t love and support butches and trans lesbians, what are you even doing with your life? 

“I’ve decided nothing is more beautiful than kindness, so I will be nice to others.”s.s. (stephenstilwell)

some days pass by and leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling inside, those are the days you should jot down in a gratitude journal to flip back through on your not so great days to remember why you love life and being alive. When you’re in a dark place, your mind tricks you into thinking that all days are like this and covers your memories in a film of grey and ugliness. Hold on to those days that leave you feeling like there’s sunshine in your chest, take photos to remember them by, write poems to memorialise them. Even post about them to tumblr! Find a way to access them on the days where you’re feeling all bleak emotions or no emotions at all, trust me. You won’t regret it.

remember animals don’t gender you, so they don’t misgender you. You will always be accepted by your petsalso remember the story of the trans guy whose cat started meowing deeper to match his voice as he was on hrt 

It’s okay if you can’t be positive all the time. It’s okay to take time to vent your negative emotions. Forced and faked positivity aren’t helpful, and anyone who would rather you be unconditionally positive no matter what you’re going through doesn’t have your best interests at heart. Positivity doesn’t have to be all aesthetic and smiles all the time. Sometimes it’s letting yourself feel your sadness and anger, but knowing you can get through this.

Personal goal: to stop feeling guilty when I need to take a break. I am not not a machine and taking time for myself does not mean I’m lazy. It’s normal to need time to recharge.

you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being alive. you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being here. you don’t have to prove yourself worthy of being loved. there are no terms and conditions to your right to exist. 

 

1. The relationship should be natural, easy and uncomplicated: The truth is that all relationships take time, effort, commitment and energy. You need to make time for each other, to do fun things together, to work on communication, and to learn to negotiate and compromise.

2. The relationship should be conflict free: Because we are each individual and unique we all disagree with others at times, so conflict is natural, and not to be feared. In fact, conflict can force us to confront our differences, and to grow as individuals, and as couples too.

3. Soul mates are romantic: Real life is not the movies, and love can be expressed in countless different ways, and still be genuine. Look out for all the signs that show your partner cares, and don’t be disappointed if they’re not “the stereotype”. Don’t force them to be something that is maybe nor their style.

4. You should always see things the same way and have the same opinions, outlooks and beliefs: You both have different backgrounds and have individual brains so you’re going to sometimes differ in the way you look at life. That needn’t be a problem – you don’t want to be clones.

5. My soul mate will always like and love me: Consideration, respect and a concern for your partner are symptoms of a loving relationship. But being rude and disrespectful or irresponsible are not endearing qualities that build relationships. Instead, we need to give to get – as it’s not “all about me”.  

It’s okay to feel tired. Take yourself to bed at 9pm, and tuck yourself in like the cute burrito you are. Tomorrow is new and full of opportunities.

Nintendo has shown their true colors. Their Pokemon games promote such twisted activities as-Go for a walk-Get some sleepThat’s right, it turns out that Nintendo’s secret agenda was to brainwash their players into deviant acts of self-care, the fiends. 
If you struggled with starting something you were putting off for a long time today, I am proud of you. If you finally had the courage to talk about your feelings and opened up to someone, I am proud of you. If you have taken care of yourself (in whatever form) even though you were feeling your absolute worst, I am proud of you. You do not have to complete your entire to-do list or achieve something extraordinarily big to have value. You are worthy just because you exist and your value is undeniable. Good job, my love, I am so incredibly proud of you. 
To heal is to step out of your own victimhood. You are not what happened to you, it is not a reflection of who you are. Yes it happened and can be a part of you. But is both apart from you and a part – it is not you or who you are. To base who you are solely around your trauma is self sabotaging and means that you can never heal. You are still picking at that scab and opening it up again. Stop touching your wound. It’s like a scar on your arm or leg. It is there. It exists. It’s ugly. It can hurt and ache because the scar tissue is deep but your whole body isn’t the scar. Your trauma isn’t who you are. Step up and into the unknown and into the real true you outside of your scar. 
Lessons 2“I was completely frozen after graduation. I’m only just starting to thaw six months later. I realized that if i broke tasks into small steps, it became a lot easier to take my life and get it under control.”  
going to therapy is nothing to be ashamed of. that is the bravest thing a person can do once they realize that help is needed in order to get back on the road and strive for the better, healthy version of oneself  
please remember to take a quick break to ask for help if you need it !!! ✌✌✌

Remember: don’t get mad at yourself for not meeting goals in the time you wanted to. You’ll get there, it just might take you longer than you thought, and you might not take the most direct way of getting there, but you will get there. Give yourself some slack!

{Be kind to yourself} 

i loathe the fact that so many traumatised people feel they deserve to die. you never deserved that. you have always deserved a life that feels good to you, full of things that are enjoyable. the fact that you were cheated out of these things for a period of time does not mean that you will never get to have them m, or that you are no longer capable of having them. you deserve more than many people can give you. or at least, more than many people know. 

Nobody asked you 🤪 
Messy hair don’t care 🤷🏻‍♀️  

please remember to take a quick break to have some food if you haven’t yet! 🌸🌸 

 

Finally home after feeling like complete shit 💩  

please dont forget to relax and find something calm to think about!!! 🌻 

4 day streakSo far, every day this week I have - taken a shower- brushed my teeth - washed my face - ate a healthy breakfast - followed a workout routine - taken at least an 1.5 mile walk - ate a healthy lunch- drank lots of water - write positive affirmations in a journalThis might seem dumb to some. But it’s a good feeling getting yourself out of a dark place. Still a work in progress…But progress is progress.

Pt 8/13 of it’s all mess here!! Thank you so much for continuing to read through this series!! I’m so happy everyone has been enjoying it so far! Only 5 left! 🖤🖤 

some self-care ideas i came up with and also from others i’ve searched.  

I do this ALL the time. It’s a really hard habit to break. There are so many things we think that we should be doing and ideas about where we should be in life. Changing “should” to “could” reduces the shame and promotes autonomy. Just because you CAN do something doesn’t mean you HAVE to, and that’s the difference.  

adjust your posture !! 💯💯💯 

2016: pokemon go. get outside and get some fresh air and exercise!2019: pokemon sleep. please try to keep a somewhat consistent and healthy sleep schedule PLEASE2022: pokemon go to therapy and work out your past trauma honestly we’re so worried about y

Eating disorders often go hand in hand with depression; either binge eating or anorexia.. It can be difficult to do anything when you live with mental illness so again, please be kind. There is no reason for anyone to be commenting on someone else’s eating habits. As always… we’re all doing our best.
Thank you all for reading and following me!! Your support means everything to me 😘💫♥️ 

Equating your value as a person to your rate and quantity of manual labor is a capitalist construct, and a critical misunderstanding of what it means to truly live. Centralized governments have that effect on people. But you’re not a number, and you’re not just a cog in the system. You’re you! Back-breaking work isn’t your intended purpose. The meaning of life is a question with a thousand subjective answers, but the closest converging thread is simply: To exist.You are valuable because you exist. You exist in the hearts and minds of people all around you, whether that means you’re just a passing neighbor or a dear friend. No matter the number of encounters you maintain regularly, what matters is that you have them to begin with. What matters is that you leave a ripple entirely unique to yourself, and it effects the world around you. You create millions of stories with your very presence in the lives of others, and with your own method of living.The end goal isn’t perfection. It isn’t what you can produce, it isn’t beating down the competition. It’s about human connection. It’s about the love you give and receive. And I think that’s more meaningful than any work you do for the hollow quotas of the corporate hivemind. So… don’t lose sight of that worth. It’s yours to preserve. 

take a moment rn to take your meds 🙌🙌🙌 

dont forget to eat some fruit !! ✌

being gay is okay. being bisexual is okay. being straight is okay. being asexual is okay. being lesbian is okay. being pansexual is okay. being attracted to who you are attracted to is okay. being yourself is okay. being an asshole to people just because they are different from you is not okay.

If you feel like you have no purpose, consider this: Your words, actions and smiles have made someone’s day brighter. You may feel as if the world doesn’t need you but trust me, it does. You have no idea how many lives you have already saved through your kindness. You are needed.

Sometimes it’s nice to just chill 💛 (c:        

Never be ashamed of feeling proud of small achievements. Got out of bed today? Great! Changed into a fresh pair of sweatpants? Amazing! Had two glasses of water? Incredible! Made it out of the house to run some errands? Wonderful! On some days tasks like these seem almost unattainable and that is absolutely okay. Do not be too hard on yourself, instead give yourself credit and allow yourself to celebrate the little victories. You are doing so great. 

take some time and adjust your posture!!! 🙌🙌🙌 

My worth is not defined by my productivityEven if I do not produce, I am kind, I am worthy, I am intelligent, I am lovely, I am not a waste of space nor air  

remember to check in with yourself. make sure you’ve eaten enough. take a break if you need one, or nap if you’re sleep deprived. you need to take care of yourself first!!  

What you are doing is important. Please do not ever think that your art, your music, your words, your writing, your help, your kindness or your career is not good enough. Everything you do is absolutely meaningful. You are doing big things even if you do not feel like it. You actions are so important. Please do not ever tell yourself that you are doing nothing purposeful with your life, because trust me, you are. The world needs you and everything you do. 

take a little time right now to eat some fruit!! ⭐ 

it’s okay if you didn’t feel productive today, that’s not our only purpose

Not my work but a lil cute reminder of some self care ideas.  

please take some time and look at a bird or something !!! 🌼🌼🌼 

You are still here. You are still breathing. All the things you have messed up: the words you ended up regretting, the mistakes you made at work or the tests you failed at shool; they simply do not matter. At the end of the day all that really counts is that you are still trying and that your heart is still beating. 

you know those scenes in superhero movies where the protagonist goes somewhere secret to change into their superhero outfit and when they’re done they look over and there’s a random person who just saw everything? that’s what I felt like just now after shoving half a burrito in my mouth only to look over and see the person in the next car over staring at me in mild disgust and horror  

remember to take a quick break and relax and find something calm to think about 👍 

❀ Things to do on a very bad day ❀💗 Do not forget to drink water. No matter how bad you feel, simply taking a sip of water is going to make you feel at least a little better!💗 Although you might not feel like making an effort to prepare something to eat, you need to eat something. Your body needs the energy to get you through the day (even though you might not want to).💗 No matter how exhausted you feel, taking a shower and changing your clothes will always leave you feeling refreshed.💗 Open your curtains and windows. It does not have to be for long but just let some fresh air inside your room.💗 Write down your feelings and thoughts. Do not worry about how it looks, just get everything out of your system. Once everything is on paper, you will feel a little lighter.💗 Make a list of things that make you happy. It does not have to be a lot, just a few things that exist and make your life a little brighter.💗 Change your bed sheets if you have not done so in a long time. Similary to taking shower, this will instantly make you feel fresh and a little better.💗 If you have a lot of things to do, just pick the simplest task on your list and do it. Completing one task can make such a huge difference.If nothing on that list seems doable for you, please do not feel bad about it. Sometimes spending an entire day (or two or more) in bed is all you can do and that is okay. Sometimes you are here, sometimes the only thing you can do is breathe and let time pass. That does not make you any less of a fighter. You are so brave for sticking around and you can absolutely do this. I love you.

“You lean in, but never kiss me—so when I’m gone don’t you dare miss me.”s.s. (stephenstilwell) 

if you see this and have the strength to do it, drink some water, eat some yummy fruit, put some clean clothes and light a cute candle.you deserve a day of self-pampering and self-love.you have been working so hard and deserve a break!even if it’s just 1 hour of self-reflection, do it.you deserve love! 

Your biggest achievement of all time: You are still here. Despite everything you have been through, you pick up the broken pieces and carefully put them back together, over and over again. I don’t ever want to hear you say that you are weak, for there lies so much strength in trying again and again and again. 

 

• Release the tension in your shoulders
• Do some neck stretches
• Stop holding tension in your jaw
• Take a few deep breaths
• Breathe and stretch if you are wearing a binder
Happy scrolling! 

If you have had a rough day, I just want you to remember that you have so much potential. You will not feel like this forever. This is not how the rest of your life is going to be like. You have the potential to grow, heal and become a completely different version of yourself. Where you are right now is not where you will end up. So, please be patient with yourself and do not ever give up, for there is so much good to come and I want you to see this beautiful transformation. 

 

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: there’s something about being alone with a skyline and your favorite song that makes nothing else matter.  

😈 

the sun taught me to rise back up when im downthe stars taught me im not alonethe moon taught me its okay to go through phases 

 

I want you to take a moment for yourself and take a deep breath in. Just forget about everything you still need to do and please stop worrying for a second. Everything will turn out just fine. You will be okay. The right things will come to you at the right time; there is absolutely no need to stress about the future. Let everything happen the way it is supposed to, for you will not change the outcome by constantly overthinking what might happen. Do yourself a favour and enjoy what is now, instead of making yourself miserable because of something that has not even happened yet. You will be alright, I promise. 

1. A quartz stone near the oven makes your food taste better.2. Growing basil in your kitchen wards away negativity.3. Candles have longer lives when they’re kept in the freezer.4. Get a lunar calendar to stay up-to-date with moon cycles.5. A full moon increases extrasensory perception and so is the perfect time for psychic spells, rituals or potions.6. Aphrodisiacs should always be prepared during the waxing moon.7. The best time to plant herbs is when the moon is in Cancer, Libra, Scorpio or Pisces.8. Have an aloe vera plant in your kitchen, as the juice is an instant cure for minor burns and the plant itself brings good luck.9. Trust your instincts.10. Always make your intent clear during a spell.11. Sage can smell like weed sometimes, be careful of that.12. Peach and avocado pits ward off negativity.13. Write wishes on bay leaves and then burn the leaves to make sure they come true.14. Place rosehips in your wallet to attract prosperity.15. Use honey to sweeten the outcomes of your spells.16. Stir your food clockwise to banish negative spirits.17. Store your crystals in bowls of salt, so they’re cleansed when you need them.18. When cleaning, sprinkle salt on the floor and go do something else. Come back to the salt after a while and sweep, so that all the negative energy is gone.19. Self-care is witchcraft. Baths are literal and metaphorical cleansing rituals. Drawing are like complex sigils to clear your mind and calm you down.20. Put dried rosemary in your home to purify and cleanse the space. 

“There’s a lot of misconceptions about when people have health challenges and restrictions. And I think you can get demonized for setting limitations and boundaries…It’s important to own & master & love what we’ve got.”Nicole Beharie❤️ 

It is okay to take a break. If you start feeling stressed, cry a lot, feel uncomfortable in social situations, eat too much or even too little, cannot handle talking to anyone because it is too exhausting or as if your world is just crumbling, then take a step back and take care of yourself. Yes, I know, you need to hand in that assignment, study for that important test, go to work because you need the money and drag yourself to places you do not want to be at just because you have to. But remember that you are the most important thing in your life. And if you keep pushing through things that will only make you feel more miserable, you will not feel better. So, take a day off, push every responsibilty aside and relax, for you deserve it so much. You have been holding on for so long and I am so proud of you. Please reward yourself by spending time alone (or with loved ones) in comfortable clothes, with a lot of snacks and a good TV show.  

need to learn to not depend on other people for happiness 

Always remember: Your anxiety is lying to you! 

In case you need to hear this today: You are not alone. You may feel absolutely lonely and as if no one really cared but there are so so many people out there who love you and who want you to be happy. I know that you are convinced that you have to do this alone because accepting help from other people is weak; it is not. In fact, there is so much strength and bravery in letting someone else be there for you. You are not alone in this. 💗 

Your not a bad person . 

📣 alRIGHT LISTEN UP                               YOU’VE GOT THIS!YOU FUCKING ROCK!!                           STOP DOUBTING YOURSELFYOU’VE GOT THIS!! 

Nicole Beharie ❤️ 

This one is for everyone who keeps fighting this battle alone, this one is for you: I know you may feel exhausted from constantly pushing through everything all by yourself, because you do not open up to people, because people just do not care, because you feel like nothing could ever help you. I see you. You are doing such an amazing job. I just want you to know that there is always someone who cares, someone who wants to listen and someone who adores you just the way you are. Do not give up because you feel as if you are alone in this, because you are not. Just look around - look around and see how many beautiful souls there are who want to fill you with nothing but light. 

If you’re looking for a sign to take a mental break, this is it 

Pro tip: write love letters to yourself. Pretend you’re someone else, someone outside of you. Praise yourself for the things you’ve accomplished and the things you are currently working on. Wax poetic about your good traits. Tell yourself the things you wish other people would tell you. Re-read and re-write as necessary.   

It’s okay to change your mind about things. It’s a normal part of growing and evolving.  

Remember that atmosphere after a stormy night. Remember how peaceful and refreshed the earth seems afterwards. Your storm will pass, too darling. You will feel caĺm and revived after the rain vanishes. Just hold on a little longer. You are doing so fine; I am incredibly proud of you. 

mental health self-care tipsthings to remember:it’s better to eat junk food than no foodif it’s too difficult for you to follow through with your whole hygiene routine (showering, skincare, flossing, etc), just do one thing. i like to brush my teeth because i think it’s the most effective in making me feel cleanerkeep a water bottle with you - it’s less effort to drink from a bottle than a glassif you need to study, try listening to music whilst doing it - it may make it less effective but it’s still 100x more effective than doing nothing. if you still can’t work, stop - resting will be more beneficial write down or make a mental list of things you have to be thankful for if you can, exercise. if that’s too hard, do a few laps of your room/house (anything is better than nothing) if you’re struggling and don’t already, please seek help. there are programs set up in a lot of countries and institutions to help you access affordable mental health assistance. even if you think it isn’t serious enough to warrant help, if you’re struggling than i guarantee it is. i can’t speak for every country, but i know in aus i’ve been able to get a medical certificate for a bad mental illness day - so don’t be afraid to take a day off work if you cannot cope. sometimes it’s necessary. i know it can be tempting, but try not to spend the whole day sleeping - avoid naps where possible and instead aim for 8 hours overnightplease please know it will get better, no matter how hard things seem now. you will be okay again, i promise 

The worst loneliness is to not be comfortable with yourself. Mark Twain  

“I had just wanted to have my own little space in your life.”s.s. (stephenstilwell) 

You matter in this world - even more than you could ever imagine. You are needed. You are loved. And I am so thankful that you are alive.

Self care 🥰 

There is more to you than what you look like. Stretch marks? Body hair? Scars? They are all perfect and they look so good on you. But there is an entire universe in your mind and a garden of beautiful flowers in your heart. You are so intelligent, kind, caring and amazing. Let these be the things that define you, for your soul is so much more important than the body that represents it. 

A self love visual spell in my grimoire.  I meditated on all the seemingly impossible things I’ve overcome in my life and reminded myself that I’m stronger than I think.
