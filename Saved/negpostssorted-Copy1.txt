( for example like a certain aesthetic or whatever )

Me: *fastes, restricts, does excercise, etc.*Someone: yOu lOoK fAt.Me: 
🍯 24-hour fasting [helps to lose stubborn weight]  🍯 vary your caloric intake and expenditure  🍯 exercise [yes it really does help]  🍯 herbal tea [keeps you full when eating can be unsatisfying]  🍯 multivitamins high in B12 [for hair and skin]  🍯 calcium gummies [i’m anorexic and lactose intolerant and this is really helpful to prevent osteoperosis]  🍯 eat healthy foods that have unsaturated fats [it will force your body to burn its stored fats]  🍯 avoid peanuts [very high in fat and calorie dense]  🍯 natural sugars and sweeteners [so much better for you]  🍯 vitamin e and collagen-rich lotion [keeps skin moisturized and tightens skin]that is all i have for now but i will try to update this post when i think of more helpful tips. stay safe, xoxo ana s.

some of my fav thinspos
I wish my weight dropped as fast as my mood does 
REMEMBERIf you’re starting again or just starting:-the first 3 or 4 days are the worst ones. You’ll feel like you need to eat, but you will get over those days REALLY FAST.-those days, you don’t need to exercise.-you need to be calm, and if you can, sleep a lot. Try to start in a weekend or some day you don’t have any responsabilities.You’ll be strong enough to get over it. You can.
Her hip bones 
do u ever just feel SO shit bc u binged and u know u have to work out to at least feel calmer but ur so exhausted so u dont wanna but u Know ur gonna have to but u keep puttin it off but ur ed is yelling at u and - 
we love a nice tiny waist :) none of the pics are mine, credits to the owners 
Random thinspo. Not me 
You can practically make anything look stylish when you’re thin. It’s literally just a crop top and shorts + an oversized jacket, but she looks good asf

Okay, but listen.You’re going to look so. Fucking. Good. When you get to your UGW. I’m not even kidding. You’re gonna look like a fucking model, I swear. And I know it’s hard to wait, and it’s hard to see the scale change by so little every day, but it’s going to be so damn worth it in the end, you just have to trust yourself, because you’re the only one who can make this happen, and you’re going to do it, I absolutely know it. Just take things one day at a time, trust in the process, trust in yourself, and you WILL get there, and you’re gonna thank yourself for it.

12 year old me: just gonna starve until i lose those few pounds, and then go right back to eating like a normal person, it’ll be okay!me, now, emotionally damaged and not a pound skinnier: 
Another before and after , 13kg difference 
A couple tips and reminders from Korean youtuber Jang E Na. I’ll list some stats down below as inspo :) if she can do it we can tooSTATS168 cm/5’6”70 kg -> 58 kg || lost 12 kg in 6 weeks58 kg -> 62 kg || gained 4 kg62 kg -> 48 kg || lost 14 kg in 6 weeksTotal: -22 kg (not sure how long it took) and maintained between 48-51 kg for 2 yearsHOW 70 kg -> 58 kgDidn’t eat and only liquid fast for 2 weeks while living with her parentsBroke her fast with SMALL AMOUNTS of food like rice, kimchi, veggiesjump roped 2000 times a day62 kg -> 48 kgKept fastingOnly eat ice, gum, vitamins, diet supplementsMaintaining at 49 kg (꿀팁/key tips)Only eat 1 meal a day + small snacksNEVER eat until you are completely full, regardless of how healthy it is. This prevents your stomach from stretching outFor her, she stayed motivated by thinking of how wasteful it would be to eat after a whole week of fastingThe key is to NOT EAT A LOT after breaking these fasts. Of course binging or eating a lot will lead to the yo-yo weight gain cycle many people suffer from. Only eat tiny controlled amounts and gradually increase to a sustainable amountIf you have plans to go out with others/eat with your family, do not eat anything all day except for that meal. Otherwise enjoy your time with them!Weigh yourself multiple times a day: when you wake up, before eating, after eating, at the end of the day. This prevents you from overeating and blowing up that numberTake vitamins to get your nutrients!Like the pictures, it takes time to maintain a low weight. It is hard and takes dedication but soon your body adapts to a new weight and smaller stomach size.!! DISCLAIMER !!she says in her videos that she does NOT recommend starving yourself to get results. There were health side effects and she recommends eating at least a little bit, especially students who live busy lives.I’m not saying this is healthy or anyone should follow it, I just decided to write these stats down because I watch her videos a lot and thought I should keep a concrete, written plan.She also reminds viewers that every person is different and even following the same plans some people may lose weight more quickly than others. But..Losing potentially 22 kg in 12 weeks HELL YEAH

food is just flavored fat 
iam such a stupid fatass. i binged again. ate half of a chocolate bar, a bowl of cereal, bread and a bite of mozzarella in like three minutes.  
Quick poll!I have a couple pictures of myself when I was at or near my lowest weight. (Have since gained so much it’s sickening)I was thinking of posting them as personal motivation, but I wasn’t even that small. Anyways, if you’d like to see them or think I should post them like this post!

Finally got around to weighing myself I’m 11lb away from my highest weight.And 25lb from my lowest weight. 
summery thinspo ☀️follow for more boards like this ☀️ requests are open :) ☀️ (not my photos, DM and I will remove) 
Being peer pressured into a binge is literal hell smh 
So I’m really pathetic…I’ve gained nearly 10lbs recently and I just want to die. I need to lose 35lbs in 7 weeks to get to my 1st goal weight before I go on vacation. That’s 5lbs a week. I don’t know if I’ll be able to do it but I feel so disgusting about myself I just need to try. I want to fast, I’m already on 18 hours just because I overslept and wasn’t hungry. I’m hoping to go the full week (168 hours) because I used to do that every month or two but haven’t been able to go longer than 3 days at all this year. It’s really pathetic so I really want to get back on track. I know I can do it, I’ve done it before, I just need to remember why I’m doing it. It’s not that hard. I just need to stop eating. Then I’ll be skinny and won’t have to be embarrassed of my body.  
Last night I bought myself a tamagotchi because i’m pretty much a child… but it really helped me with the binging feelings! I had to care for it and it’s needy af so i didn’t have time to think about binging  
My whole eating disorder feels fakeLike, I’m not even a bit skinny  
me: *binges on shit for 2 days*my ed: >:(me, laughing nervously: its good to fluctuate calories and eat more sometimes .. to help metabolism… right? my ed, cocking a gun: 
Me eating my 20th pancake at 4am while looking at thinspo: *eating noises* ohh fuck yea imma totally go on a 24 hour fast tomorrow its gonna be amazing. I can’t wait to be skinny! *eating noises*  
Would you rather complain that you’re hungry or bloated   Would you rather complain all the clothes are too big or too small   Would you rather complain being cold or being hot and sweaty from all the weight on you  Would you rather have a thigh gap or chaffing Would you rather hurt people with your bones or your weight   Would you rather be picked up like nothing or hear “why don’t I get on your back instead? ”   Would you rather people look at you in awe or disgust  every dicision you make is important   would you rather be fat or skinny? You choose  
Someone: You have an ed?? But you don’t look like it!Me: Yea, bitch, I know. That’s like the whole reason.

Low calorie & high proteinLe’s be honest. We need protein. It boosts metabolism and prevent binging. So here’s the list of options with 200 calories/lower· Tuna, canned in salt water (100g-103 calories) 23g · Cottage cheese, low fat (100g- 113 calories) 25g· Chicken (100g- 99 calories) 21,5g· Shrimps, small, white ones (100g- 59 calories) 13g· Low fat greek yoghurt (150g- 75 calories) 12g· Tofu (100g- 130 calories) 12,5g· Salmon (100g- 200 calories) 20g· Chickpeas, canned (100g- 120 calories) 6,7g· Egg white (1 medium- 17 calories) 4g· Kale (100g- 33 calories) 3,3g· Spinach (100g- 22 calories) 3g· Mushrooms (100g- 21 calories) 3g· White rice (1 cup- 144 calories) 3g· Quinoa, cooked (100g- 120 calories) 4g· Lentils, cooked (100g- 200 calories) 10g· Skim milk (1 cup- 90 calories) 8g· Black beans (½ cup, 114 calories) 7,5g· Chia seeds (1 tbsp, 50 calories) 2g· Almonds (1 tbsp/15g- 91 calories) 3,5g· Avocado (100g- 169 calories) 2g· Guava (1 cup- 112 calories) 4g· Sweet corn (100g- 109 calories) 3g· broccoli (100g- 31 calories) 3g· Bean sprouts (100g- 30 calories) 3gI started posting high protein meals on my profile, check it out x

Everything wrong in my life is because I eat Originally posted by coffeecoffeeteasleep 
you know you’re sick when your friends say 1200 cals is too low, while you think it’s too high 
Tip!If you’re about to binge, put on a facemask! You can’t really move your mouth with a facemask on and it’ll give you 15-30mins to think about if you really want to eat that. Works for me! 🌸✨Stay safe!😘 
I don’t just want skinny. I want to wither away. I want people to notice how little I’m eating and how it’s killing me. I want them to scream at me ‘Stop! It’s enough now! You’re skinny enough!’But they don’t. And I won’t stop until they do.

A rare picture of me thinking about what a failure i am after i ate half of my binge food: 
I meanI can still eat those things once i’m skinny 
I want a thigh gap so bad. I’m sick of my thighs rubbing/sticking together. It’s so uncomfortable and unattractive. If I had a thigh gap I’d never complain again (I mean, I’d love a flat stomach as well thanks).

Ok but imagine this aesthetic: food, except it’s 0 calories 
When other people say they’ve been fasting for a week and you havent been able to fast more than a day 
my body: if you don’t eat you’ll diemy brain: if you eat you’ll die 
Does anyone else fantasize about being sick? About fainting in public? About people talking behind your back about how skinny you’ve become?I just really want people to notice. To care for once.

Flat stomach/Ribs thinspo 💞 
THINSPO One of the most things I hate about being fat is that I can’t wear mom jeans or baggy jeans because every time I find a store that has sizes big enough for me they fit like skinny jeans  Sad but true 💀         so big thinspo for me

“Are you starving yourself?” 
I don’t own these photos, and of course it is not me (even if I wish I was them) Pure thinspo for you guys! ~τακε cαrε~ 
skinny in blush. 
I think that a lot of people assume that we don’t know the damage we’re causing to our bodies. Yes, we know it’s healthy to eat. Yes, we know that if we carry on, we’ll die. Yes, we know that we are burning more than just fat tissue. It’s just that we don’t care.Most of us are intelligent, we know what we’re doing. We just don’t care. 
Yeah it hurtsIt hurts to starve for days straight, to pretend everything is normal, to always count the calories and feel like you’re going to pass out everytime you stand up. But you know what hurts even more? It hurts to hear people whisper “has she gotten fatter?” It hurts to eat to the point where you hate your own existence, it hurts to feel every single ounce of fat oozing from your body and being a lonely fat nobody. Would you rather your stomach hurt for the night or your soul hurt for the rest of your life? Choose your pain wisely  
being an ana is having dreams of you eating and waking up in a panic sweat because you think you actually ate lmao

hi there angel. you’re gonna be skinny, you know that right? you’re working so hard and it’s paying off. you’re gonna be so light that your family won’t recognize your footsteps as you come down the hall. you’re gonna have those high cheekbones that you crave. the ribs showing, the nobby knees, the slender fingers. all yours. your thighs will look so soft and smooth without all that cellulite. they won’t spread to the size of russia when you sit down. no more sweaty days, skinny people don’t overheat. there’s no extra fat. you’ll be so pretty, your hair will fall differently, your jawline will be sharp enough to cut. when school ends and starts back in the fall, everyone will envy your transformation. they will all ooh and ahh over your collarbones, how dainty and angelic you look in regular clothing all because you’re skinny. don’t you want that? i know you do. i do too. we’re gonna get there.  
rlly wish i was a skinny bitch w body dysmorphia but unfortunately i’m just a fat bitch who sees the truth 
all it should take if you’re disciplined enough is three to four months. you’ll be at you goal weight in four months.the food will still be there in four months. mcdonald’s will still exist in four months. that donut place will still be there after four months. food won’t leave, it’ll still be there when you’re skinny. why eat it now? why not eat it when you’ve reached your goal?[ what i tell myself every time. ]

Me: *holding a calorie free lemon sparkling water*Me: you like this. It tastes good.Me: *takes a sip*Me: *gags* 
Come on, babies! Summers approaching and we have to lose weight ASAP!

Me: OK so let’s eat 1500 calories a day, it’s enough to lose weight but stay nourished!My fucking idiot ED brain: but what if,,,, less calories makes us lose weight fasterMe, pleading: But we don’t need to lose weight quickly, otherwise we’ll gain it back!Ed brain: but, want to be thin N O W

• real fckn ana tip • #02If you were at your goal weight, would you be shoving in all that food because “fuck it, I’ll start tomorrow”?If you were at your goal weight, would you call yourself a failure? If you were at your goal weight, would you be calling yourself fat? If you were at your goal weight, would you be crying in front of the mirror?If you were at your goal weight, would you be avoiding mirrors and reflections? If you were at your goal weight, would you be as miserable as you are now? Of course not. Take responsibility for your actions and do yourself a favor: live the way you would at your dream weight. By treating yourself with respect and care you must become the best version of yourself.How would you act? How would you think? Picture every life situation and transform it into a scenario with yourself at your goal. 
☆ this is what I want to look like when I wake up in the morning ☆ Remember to stay hydrated and keep a smile on that beautiful face ♡ I love you! 
Them: Don’t weigh yourself every morning, your weight fluctuates! You’ll only get upset!!! Me: *weighs myself every morning* I’ll be fine :)) Me every morning:

the secret to not bingingI havent binged in three years and here’s how 🍃 U need to stop fasting for days that’s just stupid. If ya gonna fast, do it 14-18 hours daily (intermittently). N if you crave junk and still wanna lose weight: Eat yo damn breakfast and lunch and skip fucking dinner (dinner always fucking kills it). Lunch is a life saver. 🍃 Allow your cravings, but only in the beginning of the day, where your body will definitely burn the calories. Even if it exceeds your calorie limit that day. Just don’t stuff your face, your body needs to be able to handle it. As long as you are hungry at the end of the day you burned everything. It’s reassurance and you should lose weight bc you’ll likely be burning fat over night. 🍃 Tbh I’ve been writing at this text for over a month. How do I put it into words? What can I say and what can’t I? What is the big secret? Well, there is no big secret. At the end of the day it’s a matter of balance and not taking things to total extremes (it always is). Also, it’s a matter of timing. You need to find what works for you. Days of fasting doesn’t work for anyone. It will ruin your daily activities. And honestly, if you’re gonna live with this damn illness, at least do it in such a way, that you can take care of your obligations and are able to have life besides it. I don’t promote shit but some people just can’t live without destructive behavior, like me. And here’s how I cope.

The little momentsThe little moment, when you 🌻 notice your collarbones sticking out without you doing something 🌻 have to use another hole in your watch band, to make it tight enough 🌻 realize you don’t need to eat as much as before, because your stomach shrinked 🌻 see the gap between your thighs for the first time 🌻 see that gap develop more and more 🌻 start noticing people staring in envy at you and your body 🌻 look at old pics of you and notice the difference 🌻 someone asks what diet you’re using, because they want to achieve the same thing 🌻 need to assure your mother you’re eating normally and you don’t have an ed 🌻 go shopping and everything you try on looks stunning on you 🌻 can wear very small and tight clothings and they still fit and look amazing on your body 🌻 can wear a big hoody while you look still small and dainty in it 🌻 notice how your cheekbones look more prominent 🌻 can see and also feel your bones easily on your whole body 🌻 the little moment you realize you lost enough weight to make a difference and to make people notice Those are the small things that keep me going, that keep me motivated… Please stay safe everyone and take care of yourself 💖 
Before and after thinspo for @jordanwix  Hope we all get this 
a collection of my all time favorite thinspo :/  i like these because they’re all pretty realistic ( except for the one with the girl in the grey sweatpants, maybe in the future hopefully ) the majority of them fit my body type as well because the one thing i am blessed with is hips so ya know soon hopefully i could look like the girl at the very bottom :) plus they fit my aEsThetic or whatever  dm me if you want a specific thinspo board! ( for example like a certain aesthetic or whatever )  
No offense…: but you’re doing this for YOU. And you know when you sneak an extra serving without tracking the calories. Or put in half the the effort to your workout. You know when you cheat yourself and you can see the results all over your stomach, thighs, calves, arms, and back. You get what you put in. Put in the effort to take the stairs each time, leave the last few bites on your plate, drink the extra glasses of water. Simple. This is for you. Don’t cheat yourself.  
Fake it. Tell yourself you’re already that cute tiny dainty girl. You giggle and dance and move around constantly. Of course you don’t want any sugary food, it’ll make your tiny stomach ache. Skip breakfast and lunch and by nighttime you’ll slide into tiny velvet dresses that will still bunch up around your cinched waist. Eventually, you’ll start to see this version of yourself in the mirror too.  
Me after grabbing my arm and having a huge wave of anxiety after feeling how fat it is:

My whole eating disorder feels fakeLike, I’m not even a bit skinny  
My parents checking to make sure I’m not starving myself: 
hi there angel. you’re gonna be skinny, you know that right? you’re working so hard and it’s paying off. you’re gonna be so light that your family won’t recognize your footsteps as you come down the hall. you’re gonna have those high cheekbones that you crave. the ribs showing, the nobby knees, the slender fingers. all yours. your thighs will look so soft and smooth without all that cellulite. they won’t spread to the size of russia when you sit down. no more sweaty days, skinny people don’t overheat. there’s no extra fat. you’ll be so pretty, your hair will fall differently, your jawline will be sharp enough to cut. when school ends and starts back in the fall, everyone will envy your transformation. they will all ooh and ahh over your collarbones, how dainty and angelic you look in regular clothing all because you’re skinny. don’t you want that? i know you do. i do too. we’re gonna get there.  
does anyone else think they’ll just magically stop being ugly once they reach their ugw? or is it just me?

i thought i was deadi had a experience today where my body overheated i started to lose focus in my schoolwork my heart started beating so loud and fast and hurting like a mf and i thought “omg this is it this is how i die i am going to die in the middle of art class” then i decided to try to alert someone i tapped my friends thigh my breathing was shaky and loud and my face was red and tried to tell her “get the teacher somethings happening” all that came out was a scrambled mumbled sentence and i thought i was about to faint but she understood and the teacher got her to take me real quick and since she knew i was anorexic she got a protein bar and made me eat that shit and the second i took a bite everything slowly started to calm down and i have honestly never been more terrifieddont take life for granted as someone with an ed it doesnt matter whether your bmi is high or low your heart can stop at any second

When other people say they’ve been fasting for a week and you havent been able to fast more than a day 
friend: “omg are you gonna finish that?”me suddenly becoming aware of all the fat that’s on my body: 
I do not want only to lose weightI want to look sick I want to scare peopleI want them think like I will die in a minuteI want to be skeletonI want them see all my bones I want people think that I am strongI want to be who I really amI want to die with a body I always wanted 
Reason I have for wanting to be skinny?Im a kinky bitch so heres some not so normal reasonsThese are also my personal reasons, I do not support E.D’s.This is just for me so I can look back at it as a reminder Being tied up and not having my fat squish Their hand can wrap around my throat/wrists easierBeing able to be lifted up easierMarks being more aesthetically pleasing Collar bone hickeys Being able to hold my thighs and not struggling Sitting on them and not crushing them with my weight or suffocating themNot being insecure about my body being seen naked Actually being able to do the things I want and not feeling insecure These aren’t all the reasons but it’s some of them

52 calorie chocolate ice cream/milkshake ANA TUMBLR LISTEN UP is it getting hot in your country? are you craving chocolate and ice cream? or chocolate ice cream? well i’ve got just the thing for you! i based this off of @anoxfordc0mma 0 cal vanilla ice cream so thanks for the idea love! Ingredients: - bunch of big ice cubes (0 cal) - 2 tsp unsweetened cocoa powder (24 kcal) - 100ml alpro soy milk light (28 kcal) (to make it richer, but you can substitute it for water) - 3 tsp no cal sweetener (I use Xucker Light) - 1 tsp vanilla extract or paste if desired. Sometimes I add a shot of apple cider vinegar for a metabolism boost and it still tastes great! Now blend everything together and voilà you get that entire big mug of ice cream! Honestly I could’ve gone with half of it so if 52 cals are too many, you can make half of it or add more ice to bisect the calories! happy summer! stay safe 💕

when you’re calmly perusing ed blogs and you see someone who’s gw is like 80 lbs and their current weight is like 85 and you’re just ??????? and you feel bad because obviously they’re suffering and very very ill and need help and you want them to recovery bc everyone is beautiful but some awful part of you is so.. so.. jealous,,, because she’s just so skinny 
Why eat when you’re full of self hatred amirite

not eating and losing weight makes me feel like my life is so much more put together. like i study harder, i’m more productive, i take care of myself more. i also find that i’m less jealous knowing that i’m consistently bettering myself in different ways. maybe it’s just me lol

Eating disorders don’t just change the way you think about food. They change the way you think about every single thing. Everything.

bittersweet ED things • looking at other girls and being happy that you’re not the fattest one • seeing other people eat• drinking so much water when you’re hungry that it hurts for a few minutes before you’re relieved • binging and losing weight the next day • fantasising about what it would be like to be at your goal weight • the random shivering and shaking • the blue/purple colour of your fingernails • always being colder than everyone else • shopping • a folder of thinspo

🗡how i get back on track.🔪Start to get your calories back to 600-700go on walks and stretch everydaystart drinking a shit ton of waterweigh yourself everyday morning and night. look at what you fucking did to your progress.don’t eat until after 1 pm fast for at least 18 hours. start dropping your calories fast for a whole day. no excuses weigh before and after your fast look you dropped a pound. now stick fucking to it.   
is anyone else with an ed actually so indecisive about what they want to eat?like oh do I actually want that/ is it too many cals/ is it worth it/ will it trigger a binge/ do I actually have the energy to make it?¿

How come everything looks super cute on everyone else with my body type/ weight/ height but when I wear it feel like an enormous, ugly and disgusting wale that’s about to spill out of whatever I’m wearingBody dysmorphia has entered the chat

10/10 recommend these for a good filling & low cal meal, I just tried it today and 😍I’m really struggling and I want to lose weight asap so I’m trying one meal a day under 400 to hopefully help. My body isn’t nearly what I want and I’m hella insecure atm, so meals like this that are easy to make on lazy days rlly helps.(+ my friends mad skinny, has a flat stomach, and beautiful curves that I’d die for; and here I am bein fat an ugly 😎✌) 
gross thighs and sad eyes 
SoLast night I swam for like 3 hours. Well then I went into my fucking kitchen and BINGED.I don’t feel like checking my weight. Im staying with my stepmom so I can’t just NOT EAT, ya know? My sister is underweight and constantly eats and I honestly hate myself more than usual.  
everything would be better if i was skinnier  
Thinspo ✨ 
Thank you ana 
I’m so heavy that when i sat down on the plastic stool in my art tuition it did a heavy screech and everyone looked at me and my tutor went good for you! just kill me already,ye? 
This bitch ana needs to understand that I’M the one in control. I got this.  
all i had to eat today was a vanilla latte (210 calories) and a cup of fruit which had some apple slices, grapes and cherry tomatoes (didn’t eat the tomatoes, ~150 calories).Total cals: 360 - 220 cals from exercise = 140 total calsi didn’t have a huge appetite today and thats probably due to my period affecting my emotions. i just felt too depressed to really eat anything…

Warning signs of fainting include Pale, cool, and sweaty skinLightheadedness or dizzinessA slow pulseNauseaFrequent yawningFeeling of restlessnessTightness in the chestPalpitations (feeling/hearing your heart pounding) If this happens, sit or lie down. Put your head between your knees to promote blood flow to the brain. DO NOT Slap, shake, or throw water on the victimPlace a pillow under the headAttempt to move a person unnecessarilyTry to make an unconscious person sit or stand upNever leave an unconscious person unattended at any time. If necessary, ask someone else to call 911.Those who faint usually regain consciousness within seconds to minutes ALWAYS make sure you have a fast acting carbohydrate on you. Orange juice, LifeSavers, (NOT DIET) soda, dried fruits (raisins), bananas, glucose gel/tablets, energy bars, rice cakes, pretzels, other candies. EAT THESE AS SOON AS YOU FEEL FAINT OR RIGHT AFTER YOU PASS OUT AND ARE 100% SURE THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW WITHOUT CHOKING

eating dis*rders never really leave you. they just stay dormant for awhile before surprising you unexpectedly with either the biggest binge or the wild idea to restrict again. it never truly stops. 
Tiny tiny, oh so fine.. 
You’ve heard of No binge November Now get ready for,,,Don’t binge December AndJust restricting January  
Stay hydrated sweeties.🌹 
*tries to recover**gets a binge eating disorder instead* 
Fasting TipsI personally fucking love fasting; I get this weird excited energy, butterflies in my tummy & ofc that beautiful feeling of having control. Heres how I make the most of my fasts:Removing every tempting food, whether not buying it to begin with, chucking it out or pushing it to the back of the cupboardStocking up on Panadol for headaches 🙄 also multivitamins Having distractions planned; Tv show to watch, homework to do, video games to play etcUsing fasting apps like Vora or Fast Habit. Keeping track of fasts is rewarding and helps put them in perspective Going for long, low intensity walks while listening to podcasts. I’m out of the house, burning calories and learning new things. If I’m feeling faint, dizzy or whatever obviously I don’t do physical exercise thoughWearing compression underwear helps stomach pains and cinches my body, so I’m constantly reminded why I’m fasting- for a thigh gap and tiny waistDrinking a fucking shit tonne of water. For real, do not skimp on the water. You should be peeing constantly, dehydration is a bastard and has no place in our lives. Having an array of herbal teas to spice up the water menu is a good ideaInfused water! Literally my holy grail. I cut up oranges, lemons, strawberries and cucumber and put them into jars/jugs. Satisfies sugar cravings without calories AND it’s healthy Brushing my teeth or using mouthwash every few hoursHaving thinspo EVERYWHERE. Set it as your phone/laptop background, have a folder, print it out, whatever. Have reminders of your goals everywhere you look to keep your resolve strongTaking it easy. This is not the time for high intensity exercise or stressful situations, dont push your bodyREMEMBER: hitting a plateau from fasting or very low calorie diets is horseshit. You can fast for as long as you like, but don’t be a dickhead when your body tells you it’s time to stop. Be sensible with fasting; it’s a great tool but can be dangerous if you’re silly about it.Stay safe angels!  
yall…you burn 60 calories for every hour of fasting 
reasons to drop the weight-cute clothes-dainty shoulders-girls being jealous-boys wanting you-lacy bralettes-being sexy in lingerie-small wrists-ordering clothes online with confidence-thigh gap-being able to wear xs/0-having people say “you’re so pretty” or “you’re so skinny”-COLLARBONES-your boyfriend (or girlfriend) worshipping you-short skirts-dainty feet-being picked up because you’re so light-slim face-eating more because you know you can drop it-it’s way easier to move around-working out isn’t as hard-cheekbones-oversized sweaters-you won’t have to fast anymore-wearing over the knee socks with confidence-finding vintage clothes that look good on you-and--PROVING THEM ALL WRONG💕💕💕You can do this.

I am ready to be skinny now lel 
there is a special place in hell for people who say “it’s probably just water weight” when you tell them you lost a few pounds 
🎆 jean thinspo  
restrict, restrict, restrict, restrict, restrict, restrict,you want to be thin, get rid of that fat.you want to be able to sit however you want to, jump or do whatever without having to think about all your fat jiggling. focus. 
my number 1 problem area is probably my body  
i hate posts that are like ‘just don’t eat, it’s that simple’ like no tf it’s not. hunger pains, cravings, dizziness, headaches, feeling cold 24/7, weakness, and literally passing out???! non of that is simple. i mean it’s like saying ‘just don’t breath, it’s that simple’. don’t think people who starve themselves have it easy and you’re weak for not being able to, i promise it’s not easy even if they make it seem like it is by saying ‘it’s that simple’. it’s hell. and i only listed the first things you’ll experience, there’s way more consequences to starving yourself. 
*all day fasting*evening: 
:) why :) did :) I :) eat :)  
I guess it’s true that you are what you eat, because I’m nothing… 
Me: *On my 36th hour of fasting, binge free*My parents:  
Friend: omg a venti iced vanilla latte from Starbucks is only 310 calories!!! Me in my head: enjoy your binge lol  
me: *loses half a pound*me: i am a skinny legend. i am no mere mortal and something as inconsequential as food could never appease me. tomorrow i will reach my goal weight and take over the world.me: *gains half a pound*me: this is it. the end. i can feel my bones straining under this extra weight. they are screaming for mercy. i’m going to be 800 lbs and you won’t be able to tell what’s me and what’s the couch. i know not the old me, i now go by the name of ‘blobfish’ 
Game plan. 1. Say no to food. It’ll suck for a minute, but you’ll get over it. 2. Repeat. 3. One day, wake up thin.  
is anyone else in that stage where logically you’re not fat but you’re not skinny either and you know if you just lost a few pounds you’d be able to see a real difference but you just dont have the motivation because somedays you love your body and other days you’re embarrassed to be out in public?? no?? just me?? ok… 
Imagine looking like this in a swimsuit. 🕊 
when you start fasting and mom buys your favorite food 
being an ana is having dreams of you eating and waking up in a panic sweat because you think you actually ate lmao

full body thinspo ✨ and to anyone who ever doubted me, i’ll show them how strong i really am. i’ll shock them with my delicate frame and prove them wrong.  
all it should take if you’re disciplined enough is three to four months. you’ll be at you goal weight in four months.the food will still be there in four months. mcdonald’s will still exist in four months. that donut place will still be there after four months. food won’t leave, it’ll still be there when you’re skinny. why eat it now? why not eat it when you’ve reached your goal?[ what i tell myself every time. ] 
the tealiterally stop complaining about not losing weight if you arent sticking to your calorie limit and putting in the work. nobody is going to do the work for you. youre the one who has the choice of having an extra snack before bed or shaking off the laziness and really working out. stop creating a problem for yourself by choosing to not stick to limits and commit to working out in some form, bc nobody else feels bad for you when you dont lose weight. quit wasting time. its sad.  
me ranting on my tumblr every single day about how i broke my fast & that im a fat piece of shit and deserve to die

I can’t be the only one that thinks they’re going to get fatter after eating 1700-1800 calories a day for a few days. I have to keep telling myself that it’s still below the daily recommended value for females.

Look at yourself. Look at how many times you’ve failed over the school year. It’s pathetic! You swore you’d have that bikini body by the time school ended and look how that ended up! You’re still a fat pig with a stomach that sticks out and thighs that jiggle when you walk. Forget the pool, forget shorts, and forget tank tops. Your arms are too gross for anyone to even want to glance at. You, my dear, are going to work your ass off this summer. You have the extra time. You will go to the gym, you will skip more meals, and you will chug that water like your life depends on it. Then, when you come back to school, everyone will be amazed by what they see.“Hey! Woah, you’ve lost so much weight!”“I’m impressed!”“What’s your secret?!”You’ll be an inspiration. And no one has to know. Just do this one thing for me and don’t fuck it up. It’s that simple.

I no longer care about what my butt looks like or keeping big boobs, all I want is for people to see my bones, I am willing to do whatever it takes.. 
food is just flavored fat 
The past few days I’ve been losing weight very quickly and I’m really proud of that. The problem is that I’ve doing that by fasting and eating REALLY little and now I’m scared that when I start eating a little bit more by body is gonna hold on to Every Single Thing it gets. I really don’t want to gain all the weight back in a week…. 
Do it for the Collar BonesDo it for theRib CagesDo it for theThigh GapsDo it for theHead TurnsDo it for the Have You Lost Weight?  
I have an ED, don’t touch any part of my body for any reason. I will cry.  
it all started with the excitement of restricting. eating only 1000 calories at first was so exciting, so forbidden when i skipped lunch and lied to my mum. the abnormal thrill of feeling empty. taking a risky step and only eating 700 calories. my stomach rumbling filling me with adrenaline. skipping breakfast and lunch. eating only one meal with my family and lying about having food with friends out in town while i went to the gym instead. the intoxicating feeling of dropping down to 500 calories. dropping kilo after kilo each week. my ribs and hips cutting my hands each time i grazed my body. sweaters hiding my addiction. the taboo 0 calories. fasting and filling my empty tummy with coffee and ice. telling my brother i’m eating out with friends for dinner. stepping on the scale every hour to see the numbers decrease before my eyes. it all started with the small excitement of restricting. 
Anyone else with a ED hate how they look, but still check every reflection available? 
So you’ve all heard that “Tumblr goes PG-13″ on Dec 17. Here is a thumbnail summary of what will happen and what I’ll be doing …..1. On December 17, all images that Tumblr’s cunning algorithms decide are “NSFW” will be flipped to “Private.” No one but you will be able to see NSFW images on your blog, and you will be unable to see any NSFW images on anyone else’s blog. That’s it. THEY ARE NOT DELETING NSFW BLOGS. Just flipping adult images to Private. Calm your tits, people!2. Text, however, is not affected by this new “PG-13″ policy.3. My blog has evolved to pretty much 90% text and SFW images anyway, so based on their blurb, I’m thinking my blog might be unscathed. I’ll just have to refrain from posting the odd kinky-fuckery GIF now and then.4. So on December 18, I plan to be right where I am, right here, dispensing my usual stellar combination of Yoda-esque wisdom and curmudgeonly tough-love.5. Depending on how barren and arid things get here, I may start putting more energy into my kinkspace.net account, instructor144.6. But until it becomes untenable here on Tumblr, this blog will be my “hill do die on.”So, we’ll see how things go. Don’t shit the bed just yet, people. This is a community, and communities like ours are damned hard to kill. 
yeah i’m skinnys- so goddamn fatk- kinda suicidali-  intensely obesen- not skinnyn- not cutey- yucky! 
Person: “You look so good keep it up”  Ana:   
Me: drops food on the groundMe: …Me: oh thank god   Some of us may purgeBinge Slice our skinEat 500 calories Eat 1000 calories Some of us are thinSome of us are over weight Boy or girl. Transgender, lesbian, gay, straight, queer, etc No matter our skin color, background, or personalityAn eating disorder found its way into our hearts. But one thing they don’t mention about this community enough Is that we’re a family. We love each other. It’s sad that we came together this way. But every time you purge,binge, or slice your skin- just know that I love you. Instead of “stay safe” say I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you I love you. -smallutopia 
because i swear all my problems come back to the fact that i’m fat. 
Hmm is today a “eat everything” or “eat nothing” day? 
I just want to be skinny and small. I want to have a flat stomach and a noticeable rib cage. I want to have collarbones and hip bones. I want to have thin thighs and thin arms. I want to have self control. I want to be able to not be consumed by hunger. I want to be beautiful and dainty and desirable. I want to be both internally and externally beautiful. I want to be thought of as pretty. I want to wear tight clothes and not feel fat. I want to be beautiful. I want to be wanted.  
it’s not like I don’t KNOW that this shit is dangerous, but skipping meals and fasting and counting calories makes me feel c a l m  &  s a f e it’s not like I don’t WANT to recover, but rn I physically, mentally, and emotionally c a n t  
Am I the only one who refuses to eat a proper meal because it’s too much but instead goes and binge on a fucking bag of chips  
Bruised body/leg check for y’all 104.4 lbs  I gained weight and I’m mad but I have a thigh gap even when I cross my ankles so I’m not that mad 
just wanted to know how many people with eating disorders out their are lgbt 
I just realized that when I stay at my calorie limit and work out everyday I lose weight  
Thigh gap thinspo ☕ 
Me: eats nothing for 3 days straight, consumes under 500 calories a day, considers gum a meal.Also me: Does one face maskMe: I love self care! <3 
TbhI just imagine that whenever I hear my stomach growling that it’s the sound of it eating my fat. Idk why dude, but that just keeps me going.  
Does anyone else get super off track then one day come back to reality and think OH NO I’VE FUCKED UP REAL BAD 
Self-control is standing in the kitchen at 2am in front of an open refrigerator, a box with oh-so-tempting Chinese takeout leftovers already in your hands, but rather than doing the obvious, you breathe, close your eyes for a moment, put the box back down and shut the refrigerator again. You’ll have a few grapes from the bowl on the kitchen counter instead and head back to your room.Because it wouldn’t have been worth it. Five minutes of bliss that you’d spend on shoving this food down your throat simply isn’t worth the crying, self-loathe and feeling that you’ve failed again that’d follow afterwards. There’s nobody else but you in the control. And I promise that once you can really say that, you’ll feel much more content inside than another binge would’ve made you feel.

ANA TIP: DONT THINK ABOUT IT!ok sounds crazy i know but hear me outlately i’ve been seeing posts about how much it’s easier to fast/restrict when you’re not constantly thinking about foodkinda like that saying “the best diet is the one you don’t know you’re on”which makes sense because obsessive counting turns into obsessive thinking, which turns into heightened emotions, which in turn leads to emotional urges like binging and purging.trust mebeen there done thatmy obsession with restraining myself got me into such a horrible mental state that i had to force myself to delete all my calorie counting apps, my tumblr, etc and recover just so i could get peace of mind again so instead of obsession, try careful planningplan on having distractions at the ready don’t let yourself be boredmeditate or take a walk if it calms your mindor better yettry not to get into this lifestyle at all stay safe y’all 💜

always look your best. clean clothes, groomed hair, makeup if you wear it. this is the first thing people see about you and you want to make a good impression.if you’re in school, study for at least an hour a day. aim for the A’s, as anything less is not up to standard. if you need inspiration, join the study community online and have the perfect notes and stationary.exercise every day for at least an hour. be in the best physical condition that you can.sleep a minimum of 6 hours a day - 8 hours is preferred, but it’s not always possible. don’t let there be those ugly bags under your eyes.only eat things you know the exact calorie count in, and don’t go over your limit. you don’t want to gain weight like a fatty.never put junk in your body. avoid animal products, eat raw and organic when possible. you want to be good for the environment and good to your body. stay organised. perfect people aren’t a mess. keep your living space clean, you don’t want to live like a pig. read every day. read classics, read newer books - be well read. if you can’t read physical print, audio books are okay too. being perfect doesn’t discriminate against learning disabilities or vision impairment. if you can work, hold down a job and work your hardest at it. be nice. smile a lot. nothing should bother you, you’re stronger and better than that.keep your social media updated. it’s another platform to show off your perfect life and your passions. make people envious.
