 @scumtier<3 <3 
 reasons not to eat. - none- you deserve food- you’re beautiful- listening to your ed will never make you happy- feed your body- seek help - get off of this toxic website- you’re going to be okay - you’re going to get through this- stay strong dms are always open loves 🖤 
 ideal body type for myself: six feets under ground  
 10 Ways to avoid eating1. Take a shower - can’t eat in there2. Stay in your room - can’t reach it, can’t eat it3. Sleep - not always too healthy :/4. Take a walk - earbuds in, block all else, burn some cals5. Coke zero - unfortunately it works (unhealthy)6. Go shopping - why would you eat when you can’t even buy jeans that fit? (You don’t need to buy)7. Play a video game - can’t eat, gotta beat this 8. Watch movies in bed - entertaining 9. Thinspo - it still works10. Put on a full blown look - heels, makeup, jewelry … and food?!?!?! 🤔👎🏻👇🏻Thanks loves, have a good day 
 So ready for sweater weather🌻

 Green Tea:Normal Ana’s: Green Tea helps boost your metabolism and aids in faster weightloss, plus it literally tastes so good ♡ Here’s a list of all the benefits too. 🌼Me: Green tea tastes how I would imagine mermaid piss tastes like but alas I drink it because I’m desperate for anything to help me lose weight. I don’t even know the benefits - I’m just blindly trusting it at this point. *finger guns* 
 May is almost overLet’s play “How much weight can I lose by fasting and exercising in the next ten days?”

 Sometimes I get worried I’ll out myself for having an eating disorder, but then I remember I’m fat, so no one will believe me. 
 I’m really bad at having an eating disorder and that’s the tea

 ANA: So today we’re going to exercise our ass off. Doesn’t that sound good?Depression: Today we’re gonna lie in bed and sleep.Universe: 
 I know you can go another hour  Just drink some more water, a cup, maybe two? I’ll be here waiting for you at the finish line, just one step at a time. Take a deep breathe, chin up, you’ll get there.  Imagine you’re legs getting thinner as you become more light Imagine your wrists are daintier and your bracelet doesn’t fit anymore  Imagine your collarbones protruding without forcing your shoulders forward Imagine being happy  All you have to do is go a couple more hours without eating love. If you’re really hungry then have an apple, maybe half?  If you’ve gone to 30 hours or more take a break. You did a great job!  All of this will pay off, but you have to work for it 
 Leg check 
 Me: I want to eat somethin-Me to Me: What the FUCK did you just say? 
 Food is awful.I don’t like it anymore.The feeling of a full stomach disgusts me.The taste of food makes me think of the consequences; the disgusting fat results of what I just put in my body.I don’t enjoy food.It’s only when I’m hungry or bored do I slightly enjoy it, after that it goes back to square one. I feel like shit after each bite.Food is disgusting.Almost as disgusting as me. 
 I’m trying this amazing new diet! It’s an All Carb Diet.  I start off by fasting for 16 hours, then in 15 minutes I eat every carb I can get my hands on, then I cry for the next hour about it.I’ve been doing it for about a week and I’ve already seen major increases in self hatred! 
 me @ my ed after a binge 
 If you fast for longer than 5-10 days, you are at risk for refeeding syndrome. When you break your fast the fluids and electrolytes in your body shift. This can kill you. Some of the more subtle symptoms are· Confusion· High blood pressure· Increased heart rateI know I can’t stop you from fasting for long periods of time, but when you do start eating after a fast, build up SLOWLY. Agonizingly slow. Build up your calorie intake over about 5 days, or longer if you’ve fasted for longer.  
  
 💘Imagine…💕Imagine walking through the streets and seeing everyone’s jaw drop as you float past them.💕Imagine running your fingers over your collar bones when your talking to your friends. “How are you so skinny?” they ask.💕Imagine getting the attention from the one person you crave.💕Imagine being offered food and saying “no” and meaning it.💕Imagine how weightless you will feel and how easy it would be to lift you.Now Imagine stuffing your face with food. Would you rather be the girl who floats through air, or the girl who stuffs her face?

 tips to stop your restrict/binge cycleokay so.. i hope these tips help at least a littlei am 100% pro recovery and do not reccomemd eating less than 1000 calories a dayanyway here ya go:water water water, drink water aAAALLLL day long. you should be peeing 24/7if you dont like the taste of green tea, a nocal sweetener and lemon juice makes it so yummy! over time youll get more fond of the flavor and you can slowly decrease how much sweetener you useif you need to prevent a binge, CHEW GUM! make sure its sugar free - it keeps your mouth occupied, it gives flavor after which you don’t necessarily want to eat much and it has no sugar!iced coffee (or just coffee) is a wonderful appetite suppressor but if you drink too much on an empty stomach, you’ll get really shaky and probably anxious. have decaf or eat something before having it if you want to avert thatif you’re on a low calorie diet, don’t count vegetables as calories. especially greens. they are mostly water anyway and theyre full of fiber and vitamins and if youre hungry, have some! it will most likely prevent a future binge toowhen fasting, only do low intensity workouts. dont go for a run, instead walk for however long you want to. i like to listen to podcasts because mine are around 45 minutes, plus i learn a lot while also exercising. keep yourself motivated by going on tumblr whenever youre bored on your phone. thinspo is wonderful!multifandom ana edits have saved me from a binge so many times. find something that works for you to prevent binging.learn from your mistakes. if you know you binge if u fast for too long, just dont fast for too long!! eat breakfast!! prevent future binges with veggies and healthy foods!!if you are restricting, you will lose weight. you will lose weight whether you are exercising or not. if you dont, you will still make progress!!please add any of your own tips, i need some new ones too ;) i hope this helped at least a little <3333xx 
 @cardcaptorr  
 Having an eating disorder is so weird. It’s supposed to be all wrong but it feels so normal to me. It’s become so engrained into me that I don’t second guess it anymore. I can’t imagine what being normal is.  
         80’s/90’s thinspo for @tokyothinn✨ 
 Pro tip: Every time you’re about to binge or even eat, remember to ask yourself: Do I really deserve that?  
 I HATE WHEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE“Just eat healthy and you wont want to starve or purge” like ok I could eat one almond and still want to purge that because its nOT ABOUT FOOD ITS A MENTAL ILLNESS  
 Me when I go 5 calories over my limit: 
 •Medicine -daughter⭐️  •Skin + bones -Marianas trench⭐️  •Please eat -Nicole dollganger ⭐️ •Growing pains -Maria mena ⭐️ •you’re gonna be ok -Jenna Johnson  •run forever -Emma Ruth rundle  •better by now -rituals  •breathe me -sia ⭐️ •Easier -monsionair  •possibility -Lykke li  •bird -Billie Martin  •when the darkness comes -Shelby merry  •change it all -Harrison storm ⭐️ •Cold -aqualung &a Lucy Schwartz ⭐️ •Frail love -cloves ⭐️ •anchor -novo amor  •soon we’ll be found -sia  •where’s my love -SYML  •only -RY X ⭐️ •you there -Aquilo  •caves -haux  •please don’t go -Barcelona ⭐️ •till my heart stops -too far moon  •anachronism -cry wolf ⭐️ _________________________ I highly recommend these songs especially the stared ones when it comes to ed songs, these have helped me get through so many fasts and just cravings in general, I also love to use these as motivation for when I’m working out.

 Has anyone ever actually made it through one of these no-binge months? Probably not but wtv🌸No-binge September🌸Let’s try and last longer this time  
 Me: *having a good dream about me being skinny*Me: *wakes up* 
 《♡》 
 Please don’t say tl;dr. This is important for everyone.There was a time when I first stumbled into this community, I had tried restricting before and it had helped me lose weight. I started cutting back more and more and found ed tumblr. While I found friends and support I also found ways to worsen my habits. I started by restricting to about 1500 then 1200. I thought It would be good. It wasn’t. Soon this became 1000, 800, 600 to the point that I only feel successful if I’ve eaten under 500 and panic (real panic attacks) if I have over 800. I told myself I would do this until I reach my gw and then I’d be happy and stop. It. Is. A. Lie. There is no good enough, there is no skinny enough. This disorder takes over your mind, your body and your soul. You think you’ll be able to choose when you stop, you have the illusion of control. until one day you wake up and realize that the disorder is controlling you. It’s scary. So PLEASE if you are new I URGE you to get help, delete the blog, the app, block the tags. Tell someone you love or a counsellor or a doctor. Don’t start the trip down this slippery slope because the smooth stop at the end doesn’t exist. You’ll keep sliding until you hit the bottom hard, and from there it’s so much harder to climb back up.  
 me: wow ive done pretty good lately i havent binged oncebrain: is that a challenge me: holy shit no it–brain: too fucking late half the kitchen’s gone now 👈😎👈 
 Black Thinspo (Not My Pictures) 
is anyone else with an ed actually so indecisive about what they want to eat?like oh do I actually want that/ is it too many cals/ is it worth it/ will it trigger a binge/ do I actually have the energy to make it?¿ 
I can’t be the only one that thinks they’re going to get fatter after eating 1700-1800 calories a day for a few days. I have to keep telling myself that it’s still below the daily recommended value for females.

I’m gonna be so happy. I’ll make lemonade and chill all day long and make some funky music bc I’m gonna be ok. I’ll take my dorky pup and even dorkier lad out camping and I’ll finally paint my lame desk. I’m also gonna make a cake every month bc as it turns out, I’m all about cake🌼 
everything would be better if i was skinnier

Every day. (My daily walk home only counts on the days I eat under planned)IM GOING TO FUCKING GET SKINNY.  
 
No offense…: but you’re doing this for YOU. And you know when you sneak an extra serving without tracking the calories. Or put in half the the effort to your workout. You know when you cheat yourself and you can see the results all over your stomach, thighs, calves, arms, and back. You get what you put in. Put in the effort to take the stairs each time, leave the last few bites on your plate, drink the extra glasses of water. Simple. This is for you. Don’t cheat yourself.  
Dietcoke is life.

does anyone else have a little pile of clothes and look at them and they’re like “oh, ill wear these when im finally skinny” and you keep wasting money on clothes youll probably never be able to wear because your fat ass keeps fucking eating 
soon… ✨ 
Fake it. Tell yourself you’re already that cute tiny dainty girl. You giggle and dance and move around constantly. Of course you don’t want any sugary food, it’ll make your tiny stomach ache. Skip breakfast and lunch and by nighttime you’ll slide into tiny velvet dresses that will still bunch up around your cinched waist. Eventually, you’ll start to see this version of yourself in the mirror too.  
I just want to be triggered in peace, thank u.

Meansposo your friends asked you to go to the pool. it’s been a few weeks since summer started and you want to go see them to catch up. you look all over your room for a bathing suit that fits. but none do. you’re still so fat. in shame you go wearing bottoms that you find that fit in a t-shirt. you show up to the pool excited to see your friends. as soon as you walk in all excitement drains. you’re the fattest one at the pool. the only disgusting person. the only one in a shirt. your friends barley recognize you you’re so fat. you go join them seeing their perfect bodies. thin. toned. fit. delicate. you are nothing like them. you are a fat disgusting pig. do you want this to be you?? do you want to be the embarrassment at the pool or with your friend? no. you can make it. you can be skinny. get your ass up and out of that bed and do a workout. go for a run while it’s sunny. do those crunches. sit ups. jumping jacks. find a gym and get the membership. throw away your junk food. you don’t need it. know what you do need? to be skinny. you are in control. lose that fucking weight you slob. be useful for once.  
Mom: You’re looking so thin!Granny: Wow you’ve lost so much weight!Old Ballet Teacher: You’re so skinny!Me: Hahaha really? Lol I’m not doing it on purpose, I’m still eating all the junk food I usually do.Also me: *starves myself, counts calories, does body checks every time I walk past a mirror*

Does anyone have any experience with appetite suppressant pills? Do they work? Are they worth it? Are some better than others? Can I have some opinions? I want to try them but I want to know a little more about them first. And if they don’t really work, I don’t wanna waste my money 😅

🌿  
I have been hopelessly trying to lose weight for the last year and a half… I have no progress. I need someone to give me some exercise tips. What exercises are the best for weight loss and such? I am already doing fasts and restrictions, but they don’t help, so I think I need exercise tips, to reach my GW. Please message me any advice I am slowly giving up, and I don’t want to live and be fat. 
Warning signs of fainting include Pale, cool, and sweaty skinLightheadedness or dizzinessA slow pulseNauseaFrequent yawningFeeling of restlessnessTightness in the chestPalpitations (feeling/hearing your heart pounding) If this happens, sit or lie down. Put your head between your knees to promote blood flow to the brain. DO NOT Slap, shake, or throw water on the victimPlace a pillow under the headAttempt to move a person unnecessarilyTry to make an unconscious person sit or stand upNever leave an unconscious person unattended at any time. If necessary, ask someone else to call 911.Those who faint usually regain consciousness within seconds to minutes ALWAYS make sure you have a fast acting carbohydrate on you. Orange juice, LifeSavers, (NOT DIET) soda, dried fruits (raisins), bananas, glucose gel/tablets, energy bars, rice cakes, pretzels, other candies. EAT THESE AS SOON AS YOU FEEL FAINT OR RIGHT AFTER YOU PASS OUT AND ARE 100% SURE THAT YOU CAN SWALLOW WITHOUT CHOKING

TV SHOW WORKOUTS #1 - OITNBI know a lot of people out there struggle with working out, like me, which means we have to restrict even more to lose the same amount of weight that others lose. So, this is how you can work out AND watch guilt free TV!As you’re watching our show of the day, ‘Orange is the New Black’, every time something on the list pops up, do the workout assigned for it!Theme Song- Plank for full (1:12)Any Flashback from before prison - 10 lunges (per leg)Anytime you see a titty 😏 - 10 sit upsAnytime Pornstache speaks - 5 jumping jacksAnytime someone kisses - Wall sit (30 secs)Whenever you see drugs - 5 pushupsRed insults someone - 15 russian twistsSomeone cries: 10 crunches 
A friendly reminder 🌼To eat because food is fuel. Stay safe lovely people 💪🏼🍊 
 mood  
106.2 = lowest weight ever!!!!!!Woke up this morning feeling blessed  
 
Hi Babes ❤️Just a reminder that diet soda, green tea, coffee, etc. are actually diuretics so they flush more water out than what you take in and dehydrate you! So make sure to drink even more water than you think you need!Stay safe, stay strong 🌻 
Lmho I wish my weight was as low as my self esteem cuz that would honestly be goals haha 
i honestly feel terrible hahaso after my visit to the doctor i just found out i managed to lose 1kg after a week of pretty bad eating and attempted restriction, a n d apparently i’m 5’7 now which is pretty cool i guess. a bit disappointed since i could’ve of done much better but it isn’t bad considering how busy and overall chaotic this week was thanks to the multiple doctor appointments. can’t wait to get today over with too so i can finally stop pretending to be healthy and restrict again, i always think i’ll feel okay when i eat normally but really that thought lasts for like, three minutes into it and after that i’m so uncomfortable and mad with everything. this week was utter hell, i feel so fat, i’m mad because i prolly slowed down my progress with the normal eating and i highkey want to die now lol but what’s new ahaha :”)  
Weight Diary #1Yesterday’s Weight: 185.6Today’s Weight: 185.6Maintained, but I’m kind of glad, because I had a binge, and definitely thought that I would gain like 68lbs. 
May 28I went back to where I was Im so fucking mad I should be at least 65.0 KG rn but at least Im not gaining Also tomorrow I will meet a virtual friend and Im happy but worried about the food I will have bUT it’s ok 
i thought i was deadi had a experience today where my body overheated i started to lose focus in my schoolwork my heart started beating so loud and fast and hurting like a mf and i thought “omg this is it this is how i die i am going to die in the middle of art class” then i decided to try to alert someone i tapped my friends thigh my breathing was shaky and loud and my face was red and tried to tell her “get the teacher somethings happening” all that came out was a scrambled mumbled sentence and i thought i was about to faint but she understood and the teacher got her to take me real quick and since she knew i was anorexic she got a protein bar and made me eat that shit and the second i took a bite everything slowly started to calm down and i have honestly never been more terrifieddont take life for granted as someone with an ed it doesnt matter whether your bmi is high or low your heart can stop at any second

 Mini QuesadillaYou may not expect cheese quesadillas to make a list of low-calorie snacks, but try this recipe: sprinkle an ounce of grated low-fat cheddar cheese over a corn tortilla. Fold in half and microwave for 20 seconds. This quick and tasty snack has only 100 calories and 1.3 g of saturated fat.Saturated Fat: 1.3 gSodium: 182 mgCholesterol: 6 mgCalories: 100Cottage Cheese & CanatloupeCottage cheese is a protein powerhouse, with ½ cup delivering 14 g. Like fiber, protein can help you stay full longer. Enjoy low-fat cottage cheese plain or with a side of fruit. A small wedge of cantaloupe brings the total calories to 100. I personally don’t like cottage cheese but if you do.Saturated Fat: 0.7 gSodium: 468 mgCholesterol: 5 mgCalories: 100Three Crackers With CheeseChoosing whole-grain crackers is the key to this classic snack. The fiber will keep you feeling full between meals, and the cheese provides protein and calcium. To stay under 100 calories, cut up one slice of low-fat cheese and split it over three crackers.Saturated Fat: 1.2 gSodium: 397 mgCholesterol: 7 mgCalories: 98Fourteen AlmondsWhen the munchies strike while you’re on the go, there are few things more convenient than nuts. You can eat 14 almonds without hitting the 100-calorie mark. Plus, they’re rich in fiber and protein, which help keep hunger at bay. Saturated Fat: 0.63 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 98Six Whole-Grain Pretzel SticksFor those who don’t like nuts, pretzels are just as convenient when you’re on the move. To stay under 100 calories, stick to six whole-grain pretzel sticks. This snack is cholesterol-free, low in fat and sugar, and provides more than 3 g of fiber to help tide you over.Saturated Fat: 0.4gSodium: 257mgCholesterol: 0 mCalories: 96Baked AppleApples are still one of the healthiest snacks around, and there are plenty of ways to put a twist on this old standby. Blake recommends enjoying baked apples – they taste like dessert but provide the same vitamins and fiber as their fresh counterparts. You can even sprinkle cinnamon on top without adding calories.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 95Cheese-Stuffed Pita PocketHere’s one that’s easy to make and gives you the satisfaction of biting into a sandwich. Grab a whole-grain pita pocket and stuff it with ½ ounce part-skim ricotta cheese. The fiber and protein will help fill you up, and the whole snack has less than a gram of saturated fat.Saturated Fat: 0.8 gSodium: 149 mgCholesterol: 4 mgCalories: 94Blueberry SmoothieA fruit smoothie offers a scrumptious way to get in some extra calcium and antioxidants during your day. Try blending 1/3 cup of nonfat yogurt with 2/3 cup of frozen blueberries and ice. “It’s very refreshing and very cold,” Blake says. “That slows down your ability to drink quickly.” Snacks that take more time to finish are often more satisfying.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 59 mgCholesterol: 2 mgCalories: 931/3 Cup EdamameThese young soybeans are among the healthiest snacks you can find. A half a cup has more than 8 g of protein and 4 g of fiber to help keep you full. As a bonus, you’ll get nearly 10% of your recommended daily allowance of iron. Edamame is available in ready-to-eat containers for a quick snack on the run.Saturated Fat: 0.5 gSodium: 4.5 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 92¾ Cup Frozen Mango CubesYou can buy these pre-packaged or make them yourself. It’s like having frozen candy. It’s a great way to get beta-carotene and fiber while satisfying your sweet tooth. A ¾ cup serving has just 90 calories and provides 60% of your recommended daily allowance of vitamin C.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Eight Baby Carrots with HummusWhen you’re craving a satisfying crunch, dip eight large baby carrots into 2 tablespoons of hummus. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A and beta carotene, while hummus adds protein. Pre-packaged baby carrots are convenient, and there are many varieties of hummus available.Saturated fat: 0.4 gSodium: 210 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Apple Slices With Peanut ButterMixing sweet with salty is a tried and true way to satisfy the munchies. Measure ¾ cup of apple slices and spread a thin layer of unsalted peanut butter on each slice. To stay near the 90-calorie mark, don’t use more than 2 teaspoons of peanut butter in all.Saturated fat: 0.8 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Yogurt With Sunflower SeedsStir a teaspoon of sunflower seeds into ½ cup of nonfat plain yogurt. The seeds add plenty of texture but only 19 calories. The yogurt is a good source of protein, and the entire snack has less than half a gram of saturated fat. Make sure to use unsalted sunflower seeds, especially if you are watching your sodium.Saturated Fat: 0.26 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 88Nonfat Greek Yogurt with HoneyGreek yogurt is known for its extra-creamy texture and high protein content. Just ½ cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt has 12 g of protein to help you stay full. Drizzle on a teaspoon of honey, and the whole snack totals 84 calories.  The best part is, you may feel like you’re eating dessert.Saturated fat: 0 gSodium: 53.5 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 84Half a Baked Potato with SalsaMicrowave a baked potato for an easy snack that’s loaded with vitamin C, not with calories. Half of a medium-sized baked potato has 80 calories – keep the skin, which is packed with nutrients. Spread a heaping tablespoon of salsa on top to spice it up and you will still keep it under 100 calories.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 124 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 84Frozen Yogurt SandwichNonfat frozen yogurt is a healthy alternative to ice cream, and it’s easy to find varieties with no added sugar. Try making a “FroYo” sandwich by spreading two tablespoons of nonfat frozen yogurt between two graham cracker squares. Even with chocolate frozen yogurt, you’re only looking at 84 calories.Saturated Fat: 0.13 gSodium: 104 mgCholesterol: 1 mgCalories: 8420 PistachiosDon’t let the high fat content in pistachios scare you off – most of the fat is unsaturated or “good” fat. Eat 20 pistachios, and you’ll only take in 80 calories and less than a gram of saturated fat. Plus, they’re rich in protein, fiber, and several key vitamins and minerals. To avoid an unhealthy dose of sodium, eat them raw or dry roasted without salt.Saturated Fat: 0.8 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 80Frozen Banana PopIf you’re looking for a creative way to add more fruit to your diet, try frozen banana pops. Slice several peeled bananas in half and insert popsicle sticks. Coat each half with an ounce of low-fat plain yogurt. Put the pops in the freezer, and soon you’ll have ready-to-eat low-calorie treats. At just under 80 calories a pop, this is a snack you can feel good about.Saturated fat: 0.35 gSodium: 3 mgCholesterol: 7 mgCalories: 791 Cup Tomato SoupTomato soup is full of disease-fighting nutrients, but contains as little as 74 calories per cup, no cholesterol, and less than 1 gram of saturated fat. Just keep in mind that there are many varieties. Cream of tomato is significantly higher in fat and calories. When buying canned soup, look for labels that say “low sodium” and check the calorie count.Saturated Fat: 0.19 gSodium: 471 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 741/3 Cup Dry Oat Squares CerealIf you’re a cereal fan, try leaving out the milk for a convenient, low-calorie snack. Pour 1/3 cup dry oat squares cereal into baggies you can keep in the car or at your office. Each serving has 70 calories and barely any saturated fat. Other types of whole-grain cereals also work well. Just stay away from overly sweetened varieties.Saturated fat: 0.17 gSodium: 83 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 701 Cup GrapesGrapes are loaded with water, which means that a just under a cup full is 100 calories. The water content helps provide a feeling of fullness and keeps you hydrated. Grapes are also a terrific source of vitamin K and manganese, and contain some fiber to boot. They’re great eaten fresh or frozen.Saturated Fat: 0.1 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 100Smoked Salmon PinwheelFor a savory snack under 60 calories, spread 1 tablespoon of low-fat cream cheese onto a slice of smoked salmon (lox) and roll it up. This salmon pinwheel is high in protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, though the salt used to cure the salmon boosts the sodium content. Use a little less cream cheese and you can have two pinwheels for under 100 calories.Saturated Fat: 1.6 gSodium: 495 mgCholesterol: 13 mgCalories: 55One Cup Jicama Sticks and SalsaJicama root is one veggie that’s often overlooked. Yet, it is incredibly low in calories and offers a satisfying crunch. Slice the jicama into French-fry sized sticks and dip them in salsa. You can munch on an entire cupful for only 54 calories.Saturated Fat: 0.03 gSodium: 235 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 54One Cup Kale Chips  Kale is an awesome source of vitamins A, C, and K—plus calcium and fiber.  Saturated Fat: 0.5 gSodium: 230 mgFiber: 2 gProtein: 2 gCalories: 80Not-So-Super SnacksDon’t make a habit of snacking on 100-calorie packs of crackers and cookies, which are mainly made with refined flour. These snack packs may be low in calories, but they’re also low in nutrients. It’s better to make your snacks work for you by delivering protein, fiber, or antioxidants.Reblog to share these low calorie meals with othersAs Always Stay Safe

No offense…: but you’re doing this for YOU. And you know when you sneak an extra serving without tracking the calories. Or put in half the the effort to your workout. You know when you cheat yourself and you can see the results all over your stomach, thighs, calves, arms, and back. You get what you put in. Put in the effort to take the stairs each time, leave the last few bites on your plate, drink the extra glasses of water. Simple. This is for you. Don’t cheat yourself.  
literally every person: diet sodas are really bad for you anyone with an eating disorder: mMm bubl fuzzy drnk 
Does anyone else panic when someone else skips a meal? It’s like I fear that  they start losing weight, like it’s some kind of race to the goal of being skinny. 
Fake it. Tell yourself you’re already that cute tiny dainty girl. You giggle and dance and move around constantly. Of course you don’t want any sugary food, it’ll make your tiny stomach ache. Skip breakfast and lunch and by nighttime you’ll slide into tiny velvet dresses that will still bunch up around your cinched waist. Eventually, you’ll start to see this version of yourself in the mirror too.  
 
This is success  
Would you rather complain that you’re hungry or bloated  Would you rather complain all the clothes are too big or too small  Would you rather complain being cold or being hot and sweaty from all the weight on you Would you rather have a thigh gap or chaffingWould you rather hurt people with your bones or your weight  Would you rather be picked up like nothing or hear “why don’t I get on your back instead? ”  Would you rather people look at you in awe or disgust every dicision you make is important  would you rather be fat or skinny? You choose  
reasons to drop the weight-cute clothes-dainty shoulders-girls being jealous-boys wanting you-lacy bralettes-being sexy in lingerie-small wrists-ordering clothes online with confidence-thigh gap-being able to wear xs/0-having people say “you’re so pretty” or “you’re so skinny”-COLLARBONES-your boyfriend (or girlfriend) worshipping you-short skirts-dainty feet-being picked up because you’re so light-slim face-eating more because you know you can drop it-it’s way easier to move around-working out isn’t as hard-cheekbones-oversized sweaters-you won’t have to fast anymore-wearing over the knee socks with confidence-finding vintage clothes that look good on you-and--PROVING THEM ALL WRONG💕💕💕You can do this.

The guide to stopping binges  
✨ REMEMBER WHERE YOU CAME FROM ✨ 24th November 2016 vs 30th October 2018I am struggling to love my body at the moment. I’m not happy with my size, my shape, I would like to lose more weight. But today I’m looking back on where I started, I have come so far and I’m so proud of myself for the progress I’ve made.  
Seriously, why can’t I donate my extra pounds to those suffering to gain weight??? Life is so unfair… 
 A note to my bodyI am sorry. I have cut you, hit you, and burnt you. I have shoved more food into you than you can handle, jammed my fingers down your throat, and starved you for days until all you can see is stars. I’ve consumed too much alcohol, too many substances, and exercised you into the ground. But what I am the most sorry for is that I can’t seem to stop… no matter how much I want to be better for you, I don’t know how to stop this self destruction.And for that, I am truly sorry  
  
 I couldn’t control my sadness, so I started to control my weight.—Instagram quotes. 
 Have to keep reminding myself of this!

 I miss that feeling when you step on the scale and you see the numbers dropping. I miss that feeling when you walk and you started to be dizzy because you didn’t eat all day. I miss that feeling when you put Your clothes on and they look a Little bit big on you. I miss that feeling of happiness and proudness every time i say no to food. I miss that feeling when you drink water on an empty stomach. I miss that feeling when i used to lay down on the bed and started to touch My rib bones.  I miss losing weight.. 
 Me: I want to be thinSomeone: actually guys prefer…Me: actually I am not a guy 
 I’ve been fat since before puberty, and I’m ready to give that fat little girl everything she’s ever dreamed of.

 @breathlessmidnighthours asked me for fasting tips, so I decided to write a quick primer. And then I made a graphic, because I hadn’t needed to cook in three days and was bored. 😁 I started with 16:8 fasting for a month (eating in an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours, basically just skipping breakfast), then moved to OMAD (one meal a day, eating only dinner) for five months, before doing 48- and 72-hour fasts. Many people fast for 5, 7, 21, or 30 days with no problem. These are just my suggestions and what’s worked for me as a non-doctor; your experience may vary!   ▪ Keep your electrolytes up! Drink your water with a dash of sodium and potassium (I use Morton Lite Salt), take a magnesium supplement (I use NOW brand magnesium citrate), and suck on some pink Himalayan salt for added minerals. (The rule I’ve heard is that if the salt tastes okay to you and not super disgustingly salty, then your body was probably craving it.)   ▪ The salty-tasting water is weird at first, but I’ve grown to enjoy it. People who don’t like the taste can just mix the Lite Salt with a small amount of water and chug it quickly before going back to drinking regular water. I’ve never measured how much I use but just add a pinch to every glass of water I drink. You can also buy fasting drops if you’d like someone to measure for you.  ▪ If you’re experiencing headaches, use more sodium. If you’re experiencing muscle cramps, take more magnesium.   ▪ If you’re peeing too often, your body is flushing out the water that’s trying to strip it of electrolytes, so use more sodium/pink salt.  ▪ Go ahead and work out! I’ve read that it’s good for getting rid of the glycogen in your system so you can start burning fat more quickly. I’ve done hour-long sessions on my stepper with no problem.   ▪ You might feel dizziness if you stand up too quickly or work out too hard. Just take it slow if you feel any weirdness.  ▪ Never trust a fart! You’re not going to have much in your bowels after 36+ hours of fasting, so anything that comes out is going to be mostly liquid. If you feel a fart coming on, just go to the toilet. I’ve read too many horror stories about people sharting their pants.  ▪ Use coffee and sugar-free drinks sparingly as needed. The general rule is that if it’s not water, it WILL break your fast. But I really, REALLY look forward to having a cup of coffee every morning. I use a little cream or half & half and drink the cup over the course of several hours (literally one cup lasts me from 10am to 3pm or later), so I assume the insulin effect isn’t awful. It makes me feel like I’m getting to “eat” something, and I still seem to be losing plenty of weight. Other people use Diet Coke or unsweetened flavored sparkling water. It’s BEST to just drink water   (with sodium/potassium), but do what you need to to get through the fast.   ▪ Expect weightloss between 0.5 and 1 pound every day on an extended fast. You’ll gain some of this back when you begin eating again, but your net loss should still be impressive.  ▪ Eating keto during your feeding window is generally considered best practice in terms of feeling full. People say they feel much better during the first day of their fasts if they’ve eaten low-carb the day before. I personally feel much better if I’ve eaten a giant pizza dinner followed by a rich ice cream dessert because I care more about eating delicious food than feeling full, but try both out and see which you prefer.  ▪ If you feel hungry, drink a glass of cold water. You might feel OVERWHELMING hunger from time to time and think that you absolutely HAVE to eat something. In my experience, this passes after a few minutes. It really just goes away if you ignore it.▪ If you feel bad in another way, not just hungry or slightly headachy but actually bad, break your fast. Don’t beat yourself up. Try again.   ▪ Keep busy while you’re fasting. Go for a long walk, clean your house, or work out with all of the energy you’re going to have. Don’t see friends if you won’t be able to say no to the snacks/wine they’ll inevitably offer you. Also don’t do what I do and use that time to figure out what amazing food you’re going to break your fast with. 😈  ▪ A lot of people break their extended fasts with bone broth or a light snack of something like olives or nuts to see how it affects them. I’ve always just eaten whatever I wanted for dinner, never eased into it.   ▪ And my #1 tip in terms of ~how~ to fast is to not eat. JUST DON’T EAT. You’ll probably feel hungry once or twice a day, usually when you would’ve usually eaten. It’s not real! If you have fat on your body to lose, you won’t starve. Any time my stomach rumbles, I congratulate myself on the fat I’m burning. Remind yourself that you WILL eat again and go do something to occupy yourself. Fasting for me is 90% mental. It’s about willpower. I’m rarely hungry during a fast, and I’m usually feeling great, but I simply want to eat because eating is fun. JUST DON’T EAT. It’s as simple as that! To me, being able to skip meals feels like a superpower. As someone who loves to think about food every waking moment, I feel an incredible sense of accomplishment in being able to not eat. I look forward to being in a fast now and seeing what I can do.I used to worry so much about when my next meal would be, what I would do if I was out somewhere and got hungry. I used to bring food with me on airplanes and to hotels and get scared about how bad I might feel if I had to miss a meal sometime. I feel such FREEDOM from that now. Fasting for me has been life-changing.Please ask me any questions or let me know what I’ve missed! Thanks for reading! 
 💮 Reasons to lose weight that have nothing to do with outer appearance 💮💮 People can lift me in the air without any struggle or I sit in their lap and I don’t need to worry about crushing them 💮 I can cross my legs over each other comfortably and even tuck one calve behind the other (with all that extra fat between my legs it’s actually hard for me to cross legs without flexing the muscles) 💮 No more backpain from carrying all that extra weight on my tits/stomach/ribs 💮 No more heavy breathing and piglike sweating when I climb two (2) stairs 💮 I’ve got so much more money because I don’t spend it on feeding myself! New trousers? No problem. The pricey coke zero because it just tastes better? That new purse/game/book/hugeass Teddy bear I wanted for some time now? Having trouble with rent/need a new microwave bc the old one broke? No problem!! 💮 Saving time with shaving 💮 Better posture without really trying 💮 Shopping for clothes used to suck, now I simply grab what I like and it fits! 💮 Those awkward fat situations are no longer existent (You need to borrow a shirt from a cute boy and it doesn’t fit, you try to pass someone in a narrow hallway and jam your fat ass into them, ripping jeans in public etc)I’ll probably add moreStay save loves xx

I am still 79 pounds from my ugw. We need support, we need kindness. People are happy when we suffer. we wont experience the good, the different body, the fact that people notice we’re slimming down, for MONTHS, even years.

 10 Reasons I need to lose weight:1.) So I can wear anything and have it look good on me.2.) So when I shop I don’t feel like a whale compared to my friends who don’t have to worry.3.) So that I never wonder if they have a big enough size for me.4.) So that my mom will stop giving me tips on how to lose weight and implying that I’m letting myself go. 5.) So that I can be comfortable when people say “group photo!” And I won’t try to hide out until cameras are put away.6.) So that beach trips won’t give me anxiety.7.) So that my boyfriend can pick me up without shaking and breathing heavy.8.) So that my sister will stop using my weight as an insult.9.) So that people compliment me for being thin instead of “wow, look how curvy you are!” 10.) So that I can look in the mirror and smile, instead of crying.

Eating disorders are weird because one day you are afraid to eat a carrot and the next you eat an entire pint of ice cream

 Reason I have for wanting to be skinny?Im a kinky bitch so heres some not so normal reasonsThese are also my personal reasons, I do not support E.D’s.This is just for me so I can look back at it as a reminder Being tied up and not having my fat squish Their hand can wrap around my throat/wrists easierBeing able to be lifted up easierMarks being more aesthetically pleasing Collar bone hickeys Being able to hold my thighs and not struggling Sitting on them and not crushing them with my weight or suffocating themNot being insecure about my body being seen naked Actually being able to do the things I want and not feeling insecure These aren’t all the reasons but it’s some of them  
 “you hardly ever eat anymore! and when you do it’s excessive. it’s almost like you have an eating disorder!”

 Ed Culture Is…Feeling like loosing a pound means nothing,  but gaining a pound feels like it’s really 10

 Everybody is saying how they’ll be “skinny, pale, dainty” and no matter what, the word pale is always mentioned and it just kinda makes me feel bad because it seems like any other skin tone anorexia has taken the form in aren’t as vaild. So any other person of a darker complexion suffering, YOU. ARE. JUST. AS. VAILD.  
 Yeet yeet. I don’t deserve to eat  
 20 Ways to Avoid BingesGroom your eyebrows. They will always need a bit of tending to.Go out. Leave the house, leave where ever it is you have access to food. You are also less likely to binge in public.S T U D Y . You can never study too much. If you are on a break or aren’t in school, study a language you’ve always wanted to learn.Deep clean your space. Whether it be your desk, bedroom, dorm, or your whole goddamn house. It will keep you busy and it will look so good when you are done.Fall into a conspiracy theory hole.Go to the gym.Do a face mask. Healthy for your skin, and with a lot of them, you shouldn’t move your face too much. (No chewing!)Pop in a piece of gum. Better if it’s mint. It will keep your mouth busy and it will make things taste horrible for a while after.Brush your teeth. It will make the food not taste good, making the binge not as worth it.If you have a pet, take them for a walk. If you don’t, go on a walk by yourself. Discover local nature.Do a hair mask. Plan a trip that you’ve always wanted to go on. Go as far as planning train schedules, hotel rooms, make an itinerary, etc. It is an all consuming process.Research a topic you have always wanted to learn more about.Plan out tattoo ideas.Download a new game on your phone.Take a bunch of online quizzes. I have been entertained for hours doing this.Go into the Youtube blackhole. Paint your nails. That means base coat, two color coats, and a top coat. When your nails are wet you can’t really touch anything. Plus any food that you touch will taste like nail polish.Lay on the floor and look up a bunch of music that you have been meaning to listen to. Or maybe you’re just wondering if you’d like them or not.Last but not least, scroll through thinspo.Stay save loves.❤️

 💮 Reasons to lose weight that have nothing to do with outer appearance 💮💮 People can lift me in the air without any struggle or I sit in their lap and I don’t need to worry about crushing them 💮 I can cross my legs over each other comfortably and even tuck one calve behind the other (with all that extra fat between my legs it’s actually hard for me to cross legs without flexing the muscles) 💮 No more backpain from carrying all that extra weight on my tits/stomach/ribs 💮 No more heavy breathing and piglike sweating when I climb two (2) stairs 💮 I’ve got so much more money because I don’t spend it on feeding myself! New trousers? No problem. The pricey coke zero because it just tastes better? That new purse/game/book/hugeass Teddy bear I wanted for some time now? Having trouble with rent/need a new microwave bc the old one broke? No problem!! 💮 Saving time with shaving 💮 Better posture without really trying 💮 Shopping for clothes used to suck, now I simply grab what I like and it fits! 💮 Those awkward fat situations are no longer existent (You need to borrow a shirt from a cute boy and it doesn’t fit, you try to pass someone in a narrow hallway and jam your fat ass into them, ripping jeans in public etc)I’ll probably add moreStay save loves xx

 I can’t wait to wear pale pink tights and white dresses and mary janes but also classic rock tees and ripped jeans and doc martens but also tiny crop tops and adidas pants and slides but also pleated skirts and short-sleeved buttondowns and penny loafers but also mom jeans and patterned shirts and white sneakers but also peasant blouses and flare jeans and birkenstocks but also summer minidresses and converse but also corduroy overall dresses with sweaters underneath and booties but also tiny bikinis and flip flops…I can’t wait to wear anything and everything I want. 
 Why is this me? 
 Y’all, body types will literally kill me. I could be the same height as someone and weigh less, but they’ll still look skinnier and that kills me inside a lil. Anyone else?  
 I hate when people comment on my eating habits, like please shut the fuck up thanks 
 PEOPLE REALLY OUT HERE EATING 2000 CALORIES NO PROBLEM, YALL BITCHES WILD TF 
 You would think that having curves in a time where curves are worshipped and desired would have made me feel happy to have them, but in fact I feel even more disgusted with my body and I don’t see the curves that everybody talks about.All I see is fat.Everything I touch is fat.I’m fat, not curvy.

I went grocery shopping yesterday with my family and was so in control. Now I’ve been binge-free for 3 days. It’s not a lot, but it’s a start and it’s better than it has been for a long time.I think I’m gonna add a binge-free counter next to my stats. Let’s see if I can hold up this streak. 
Okay butAm I the only one who goes through different phases of my own ideal body??? Some weeks I’m like I want to be a stîçkThen I have a “I’m gonna get healthy week” and once that’s over I’m likeI want to be a slightly chubby hour glass babie pleaseJust me???It’s the reason I keep losing all my damn progress  
28/05/2019So… everything did go badly yesterday. It was mine and my boyfriend’s first anniversary. Yesterday started badly because I had gained 0.6kg… Later on my boyfriend and I decided to be in “a break” from our relationship and I fucking had to hold my emotions because I was at work and then I broke down when I got home and I binged all night long, I had insomnia as well, I couldnt sleep i could only cry and freaking fucking eat bcs thats my cope mechanism to avoid cutting myselfToday I lost 0.1kg compared to yesterday. I don’t know if I’ll eat or not but Imma stop posting the calories I eat per day just bcs.  
Y’all seem to like my shitty opinions. Luckily for you, that’s most of them.So I’ve seen countless posts condemning meanspo but posting sweetspo or simply not mentioning it at all. Which like, fair. It’s all fucked up. Anything placed out there to encourage us to keep harming ourselves is fucked up, but we all know this. The reason I don’t really like sweetspo lies in the fact that we all know to some degree that thinspo is fucked up in general. I read, “Hey sweetie, you hungry? Just have water and sit down, it’ll be ok” in the voice of a trashy manipulative human that wants to kill me 143% of the time. It is so uncomfy and makes my skin crawl to hear such damaging things put in such an uwu kind of tone. Meanspo to me is just like, knowing this is all fucked up and seeing how far it can be pushed. Sweetspo is this cringey, manipulative, this is ok just keep hurting yourself you’ll be fine type of tone that I just can’t get behind. 
Reasons I’m pro-gun control: within the last MONTH, 3 people have been murdered with guns within a half mile of my house. two of them were kids who goes to my university. I don’t know the details but I know this guy and his friend were murdered by his cousin at a party.  I’m gonna assume this was a “i’m pissed/jealous and I have a gun handy” sort of thing. the third was murdered saturday at the liquor store we use, possibly with HIS OWN GUN, because he and some other guy got into it and the gun was dropped and the killer picked it up and shot the guy three times before running off.Both incidents there were a number of people around.  If these men had tried to kill with fists or knives, there were plenty of people to pull them apart, and it’s a lot harder to kill somebody with a knife or a fist than it is with a bullet.People are always like “people still get stabbed to death and beat to death and shit murder wouldn’t STOP” like no DUH, great deduction there sherlock, it’s almost like murder wasn’t invented at the same time as the gun!  But it’s HARDER.  Bystanders are more likely to get involved.  It’s easier to survive attacks unless you’re SERIOUSLY unlucky.Guns may not kill people, but they make it a hell of a lot easier for people to kill people, and I don’t think that’s something Joe Shmoe down the street needs to have at his disposal. 
Every relapse I have feels like another sharknado sequel cause they just keep getting more and more batshit

I can’t be the only one that thinks they’re going to get fatter after eating 1700-1800 calories a day for a few days. I have to keep telling myself that it’s still below the daily recommended value for females. 
hahahah ok jokes over make me skinny and rich now

10/10 recommend these for a good filling & low cal meal, I just tried it today and 😍I’m really struggling and I want to lose weight asap so I’m trying one meal a day under 400 to hopefully help. My body isn’t nearly what I want and I’m hella insecure atm, so meals like this that are easy to make on lazy days rlly helps.(+ my friends mad skinny, has a flat stomach, and beautiful curves that I’d die for; and here I am bein fat an ugly 😎✌) 
stay safe my angels 💫  
i wanna explain this to someone but literally no one knows about my ed so i’ll just put it out here into the void (kinda long)💕i’ve always had naturally wide hips and big thighs. the top half of me is normal (but like still fat) but once you reach down to my waist, shit gets huge. i think it’s because i’m half latina, well that’s what my mom says 🤷‍♀️. my waist has always been around 10-11 inches smaller than my hips, making me kinda curvy but hidden under all my fat *cries internally*anyways, now that i’m at my smallest size ever, my wide hips lets me have a thigh gap and i’m starting to get one. when i stand normally with my feet shoulder width apart, my thighs don’t touch. they’re still fat and lumpy and gross, but they don’t touch. this has NEVER happened before to me. i thought it was impossible bc of how my body is structured. i’ve found myself standing at any reflective surface just entirely mesmerized by the *tiny* space between my thighs. i’m most insecure about my legs, they’re hella big and that makes them look short and stubby even tho they’re long. just seeing that i’m still overweight but i have a tiny thigh gap makes me feel so..idk. it’s like looking at a different person. i still 100% hate myself, but it gives me some comfort? to see myself like that? when like 2 weeks ago, i wouldn’t have even thought about it happening…maybe this can be some type of encouragement for someone else. you can do it ✨!! don’t give up, if i can get to where i am after being obese my whole life, you can lose any weight you have left :)the last time i was in the 150s was when i was in elementary school. i was never tiny, always huge. so if i can finally get somewhere, YOU most definitely can!! stay safe, beautiful 🧡

 I need advice lolTo all my gay/bi followers, how did guys realise/confirm your sexuality because I am                       ✨C O N F U S E D ✨ 
 all i had to eat today was a vanilla latte (210 calories) and a cup of fruit which had some apple slices, grapes and cherry tomatoes (didn’t eat the tomatoes, ~150 calories).Total cals: 360 - 220 cals from exercise = 140 total calsi didn’t have a huge appetite today and thats probably due to my period affecting my emotions. i just felt too depressed to really eat anything… 
 Okay. So you wanna hear my totally insane goal?I’m gonna lose 100 pounds. Yup I’m gonna do it. And the only thing that can stop me is myself.  
 to me personally, i think that not losing any weight is worse than gaining 1-2 pounds. when you gain, you know why. “i ate a cookie and didn’t workout”, “i stopped counting calories for a few days”, “i wasn’t having a good week”, etc. so when you put on a pound or two, you can assess the situation and change it. but, when you’ve exercised every day for 2 hours, eaten no more than 400 calories every day, drink gallons of water, isolate yourself from your family and friends so you won’t eat, finally feel hopeful that your goal is closer than it was…then you weigh and discover that it was all for nothing? you worked your ass off and nothing..changed? that’s true disappointment.

 Binge restrict cycles for days  
 Imagine♡~ thigh highs not rolling down. ♡~ jewelry never being too tight.♡~ shopping with confidence.♡~ the shock on peoples faces who haven’t seen you in a long time. 
 You weighed yourself today. The number went up, instead of down. You look at yourself. What happened to your waist? Your small wrists? Your thin thighs?What happened is that you ruined it. You ate everything you wanted. You didn’t feel hunger, you satisfied yourself, and what did it cost you? All this pounds are a reflection of what you did. Now tell me, are you proud?-Thoughts after weighing myself 
 When I wake up and haven’t lost 10kg overnight

Mini QuesadillaYou may not expect cheese quesadillas to make a list of low-calorie snacks, but try this recipe: sprinkle an ounce of grated low-fat cheddar cheese over a corn tortilla. Fold in half and microwave for 20 seconds. This quick and tasty snack has only 100 calories and 1.3 g of saturated fat.Saturated Fat: 1.3 gSodium: 182 mgCholesterol: 6 mgCalories: 100Cottage Cheese & CanatloupeCottage cheese is a protein powerhouse, with ½ cup delivering 14 g. Like fiber, protein can help you stay full longer. Enjoy low-fat cottage cheese plain or with a side of fruit. A small wedge of cantaloupe brings the total calories to 100. I personally don’t like cottage cheese but if you do.Saturated Fat: 0.7 gSodium: 468 mgCholesterol: 5 mgCalories: 100Three Crackers With CheeseChoosing whole-grain crackers is the key to this classic snack. The fiber will keep you feeling full between meals, and the cheese provides protein and calcium. To stay under 100 calories, cut up one slice of low-fat cheese and split it over three crackers.Saturated Fat: 1.2 gSodium: 397 mgCholesterol: 7 mgCalories: 98Fourteen AlmondsWhen the munchies strike while you’re on the go, there are few things more convenient than nuts. You can eat 14 almonds without hitting the 100-calorie mark. Plus, they’re rich in fiber and protein, which help keep hunger at bay. Saturated Fat: 0.63 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 98Six Whole-Grain Pretzel SticksFor those who don’t like nuts, pretzels are just as convenient when you’re on the move. To stay under 100 calories, stick to six whole-grain pretzel sticks. This snack is cholesterol-free, low in fat and sugar, and provides more than 3 g of fiber to help tide you over.Saturated Fat: 0.4gSodium: 257mgCholesterol: 0 mCalories: 96Baked AppleApples are still one of the healthiest snacks around, and there are plenty of ways to put a twist on this old standby. Blake recommends enjoying baked apples – they taste like dessert but provide the same vitamins and fiber as their fresh counterparts. You can even sprinkle cinnamon on top without adding calories.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 95Cheese-Stuffed Pita PocketHere’s one that’s easy to make and gives you the satisfaction of biting into a sandwich. Grab a whole-grain pita pocket and stuff it with ½ ounce part-skim ricotta cheese. The fiber and protein will help fill you up, and the whole snack has less than a gram of saturated fat.Saturated Fat: 0.8 gSodium: 149 mgCholesterol: 4 mgCalories: 94Blueberry SmoothieA fruit smoothie offers a scrumptious way to get in some extra calcium and antioxidants during your day. Try blending 1/3 cup of nonfat yogurt with 2/3 cup of frozen blueberries and ice. “It’s very refreshing and very cold,” Blake says. “That slows down your ability to drink quickly.” Snacks that take more time to finish are often more satisfying.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 59 mgCholesterol: 2 mgCalories: 931/3 Cup EdamameThese young soybeans are among the healthiest snacks you can find. A half a cup has more than 8 g of protein and 4 g of fiber to help keep you full. As a bonus, you’ll get nearly 10% of your recommended daily allowance of iron. Edamame is available in ready-to-eat containers for a quick snack on the run.Saturated Fat: 0.5 gSodium: 4.5 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 92¾ Cup Frozen Mango CubesYou can buy these pre-packaged or make them yourself. It’s like having frozen candy. It’s a great way to get beta-carotene and fiber while satisfying your sweet tooth. A ¾ cup serving has just 90 calories and provides 60% of your recommended daily allowance of vitamin C.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Eight Baby Carrots with HummusWhen you’re craving a satisfying crunch, dip eight large baby carrots into 2 tablespoons of hummus. Carrots are an excellent source of vitamin A and beta carotene, while hummus adds protein. Pre-packaged baby carrots are convenient, and there are many varieties of hummus available.Saturated fat: 0.4 gSodium: 210 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Apple Slices With Peanut ButterMixing sweet with salty is a tried and true way to satisfy the munchies. Measure ¾ cup of apple slices and spread a thin layer of unsalted peanut butter on each slice. To stay near the 90-calorie mark, don’t use more than 2 teaspoons of peanut butter in all.Saturated fat: 0.8 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 90Yogurt With Sunflower SeedsStir a teaspoon of sunflower seeds into ½ cup of nonfat plain yogurt. The seeds add plenty of texture but only 19 calories. The yogurt is a good source of protein, and the entire snack has less than half a gram of saturated fat. Make sure to use unsalted sunflower seeds, especially if you are watching your sodium.Saturated Fat: 0.26 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 88Nonfat Greek Yogurt with HoneyGreek yogurt is known for its extra-creamy texture and high protein content. Just ½ cup of nonfat plain Greek yogurt has 12 g of protein to help you stay full. Drizzle on a teaspoon of honey, and the whole snack totals 84 calories.  The best part is, you may feel like you’re eating dessert.Saturated fat: 0 gSodium: 53.5 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 84Half a Baked Potato with SalsaMicrowave a baked potato for an easy snack that’s loaded with vitamin C, not with calories. Half of a medium-sized baked potato has 80 calories – keep the skin, which is packed with nutrients. Spread a heaping tablespoon of salsa on top to spice it up and you will still keep it under 100 calories.Saturated Fat: 0 gSodium: 124 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 84Frozen Yogurt SandwichNonfat frozen yogurt is a healthy alternative to ice cream, and it’s easy to find varieties with no added sugar. Try making a “FroYo” sandwich by spreading two tablespoons of nonfat frozen yogurt between two graham cracker squares. Even with chocolate frozen yogurt, you’re only looking at 84 calories.Saturated Fat: 0.13 gSodium: 104 mgCholesterol: 1 mgCalories: 8420 PistachiosDon’t let the high fat content in pistachios scare you off – most of the fat is unsaturated or “good” fat. Eat 20 pistachios, and you’ll only take in 80 calories and less than a gram of saturated fat. Plus, they’re rich in protein, fiber, and several key vitamins and minerals. To avoid an unhealthy dose of sodium, eat them raw or dry roasted without salt.Saturated Fat: 0.8 gSodium: 0 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 80Frozen Banana PopIf you’re looking for a creative way to add more fruit to your diet, try frozen banana pops. Slice several peeled bananas in half and insert popsicle sticks. Coat each half with an ounce of low-fat plain yogurt. Put the pops in the freezer, and soon you’ll have ready-to-eat low-calorie treats. At just under 80 calories a pop, this is a snack you can feel good about.Saturated fat: 0.35 gSodium: 3 mgCholesterol: 7 mgCalories: 791 Cup Tomato SoupTomato soup is full of disease-fighting nutrients, but contains as little as 74 calories per cup, no cholesterol, and less than 1 gram of saturated fat. Just keep in mind that there are many varieties. Cream of tomato is significantly higher in fat and calories. When buying canned soup, look for labels that say “low sodium” and check the calorie count.Saturated Fat: 0.19 gSodium: 471 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 741/3 Cup Dry Oat Squares CerealIf you’re a cereal fan, try leaving out the milk for a convenient, low-calorie snack. Pour 1/3 cup dry oat squares cereal into baggies you can keep in the car or at your office. Each serving has 70 calories and barely any saturated fat. Other types of whole-grain cereals also work well. Just stay away from overly sweetened varieties.Saturated fat: 0.17 gSodium: 83 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 701 Cup GrapesGrapes are loaded with water, which means that a just under a cup full is 100 calories. The water content helps provide a feeling of fullness and keeps you hydrated. Grapes are also a terrific source of vitamin K and manganese, and contain some fiber to boot. They’re great eaten fresh or frozen.Saturated Fat: 0.1 gSodium: 2 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 100Smoked Salmon PinwheelFor a savory snack under 60 calories, spread 1 tablespoon of low-fat cream cheese onto a slice of smoked salmon (lox) and roll it up. This salmon pinwheel is high in protein and heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, though the salt used to cure the salmon boosts the sodium content. Use a little less cream cheese and you can have two pinwheels for under 100 calories.Saturated Fat: 1.6 gSodium: 495 mgCholesterol: 13 mgCalories: 55One Cup Jicama Sticks and SalsaJicama root is one veggie that’s often overlooked. Yet, it is incredibly low in calories and offers a satisfying crunch. Slice the jicama into French-fry sized sticks and dip them in salsa. You can munch on an entire cupful for only 54 calories.Saturated Fat: 0.03 gSodium: 235 mgCholesterol: 0 mgCalories: 54One Cup Kale Chips  Kale is an awesome source of vitamins A, C, and K—plus calcium and fiber.  Saturated Fat: 0.5 gSodium: 230 mgFiber: 2 gProtein: 2 gCalories: 80Not-So-Super SnacksDon’t make a habit of snacking on 100-calorie packs of crackers and cookies, which are mainly made with refined flour. These snack packs may be low in calories, but they’re also low in nutrients. It’s better to make your snacks work for you by delivering protein, fiber, or antioxidants.Reblog to share these low calorie meals with othersAs Always Stay Safe

 Calorie CountsI’m constantly looking for new ways to count calories burned, and it might be helpful for anyone else, too! So without further ado:• brushing teeth: 2 minutes = 7 calories• stretching: 1 minute = 4 calories• shower: 10 minutes = 64 calories• climbing stairs: 5 minutes = 32 calories• walking: 5 minutes at an average pace = 33 calories• crunches: 1 minute = 6 calories• ••Let me know if there are any others!

 Banish Bloat Bunny tipsI’m sure we all hate when you eat and afterwards you feel so gassy and bloated that it hurts. (Lol me every time I binge) Well here are the tips that I use to help reduce the horrible feeling and generally leave me feeling better. I hope this helps :)))1. TEA - yes I know everybody in this community is always saying drink your tea but it’s true. Sip some green tea or peppermint tea to soothe your stomach plus it makes you feel more calm which is always good2. Lemon water - if tea is not your thing or you want to double up and do both put some fresh lemon (or a pinch lemon juice) in some water to hydrate yourself3. Stay away from salt - sodium makes you bloat more so if you are already bloated this ain’t gonna help. This is why drinking liquids like water and tea can help flush out the excess sodium4. Water (but not too much) - from personal experience drinking water helps a lot but too much water can make you feel more bloated or in my case slightly ill which is never good.5. Go for a walk - sounds unappealing I know but doing some light exercise, like a walk, can help boost your digestive system and help reduce the bloat by getting the bowels working a bit more. Nothing too intense though as I don’t want you to be sick. 6. Yoga/stretch - if you want something to do without leaving your room you can do some yoga poses that help release excess gas and relive pain. Some good poses are child pose and downward dog. 7. Go to the toilet - you might be bloated because your body needs to get rid of some “stuff” so going to the toilet may help. Enough said. If you gotta go you gotta go. 8. Abdominal massage - I find this very helpful. There are tutorials online but generally rubbing small circles above the hip bones and above the belly button helps me the most and reduce the bloatStay safe :)

thigh g a p  
i just found out the amount of calories uranium has and as you can see, i’m having the most fun i’ve had in a long time🤠🤠but the fact that myfitnesspal even has the food option of uranium is just-  
i forgot how nice my home screen looks 
BingeI just binged on two trek bars and about 7 rich tea biscuits… why the fuck am I such a fat and disgusting pig? Why can’t I just gain some fucking self control? Now my stomach is sticking out loads and I’m all bloated and I look fucking horrible. Well done dickhead! 
i wanna explain this to someone but literally no one knows about my ed so i’ll just put it out here into the void (kinda long)💕i’ve always had naturally wide hips and big thighs. the top half of me is normal (but like still fat) but once you reach down to my waist, shit gets huge. i think it’s because i’m half latina, well that’s what my mom says 🤷‍♀️. my waist has always been around 10-11 inches smaller than my hips, making me kinda curvy but hidden under all my fat *cries internally*anyways, now that i’m at my smallest size ever, my wide hips lets me have a thigh gap and i’m starting to get one. when i stand normally with my feet shoulder width apart, my thighs don’t touch. they’re still fat and lumpy and gross, but they don’t touch. this has NEVER happened before to me. i thought it was impossible bc of how my body is structured. i’ve found myself standing at any reflective surface just entirely mesmerized by the *tiny* space between my thighs. i’m most insecure about my legs, they’re hella big and that makes them look short and stubby even tho they’re long. just seeing that i’m still overweight but i have a tiny thigh gap makes me feel so..idk. it’s like looking at a different person. i still 100% hate myself, but it gives me some comfort? to see myself like that? when like 2 weeks ago, i wouldn’t have even thought about it happening…maybe this can be some type of encouragement for someone else. you can do it ✨!! don’t give up, if i can get to where i am after being obese my whole life, you can lose any weight you have left :)the last time i was in the 150s was when i was in elementary school. i was never tiny, always huge. so if i can finally get somewhere, YOU most definitely can!! stay safe, beautiful 🧡

 the secret to not bingingI havent binged in three years and here’s how 🍃 U need to stop fasting for days that’s just stupid. If ya gonna fast, do it 14-18 hours daily (intermittently). N if you crave junk and still wanna lose weight: Eat yo damn breakfast and lunch and skip fucking dinner (dinner always fucking kills it). Lunch is a life saver. 🍃 Allow your cravings, but only in the beginning of the day, where your body will definitely burn the calories. Even if it exceeds your calorie limit that day. Just don’t stuff your face, your body needs to be able to handle it. As long as you are hungry at the end of the day you burned everything. It’s reassurance and you should lose weight bc you’ll likely be burning fat over night. 🍃 Tbh I’ve been writing at this text for over a month. How do I put it into words? What can I say and what can’t I? What is the big secret? Well, there is no big secret. At the end of the day it’s a matter of balance and not taking things to total extremes (it always is). Also, it’s a matter of timing. You need to find what works for you. Days of fasting doesn’t work for anyone. It will ruin your daily activities. And honestly, if you’re gonna live with this damn illness, at least do it in such a way, that you can take care of your obligations and are able to have life besides it. I don’t promote shit but some people just can’t live without destructive behavior, like me. And here’s how I cope. 
 So let me see if I got this right..Im scared to eat because I don’t want to trigger a bingeButIm scared to not eat because I don’t want to trigger a binge  
 Anyone else with a ED hate how they look, but still check every reflection available? 
  
 drink water until it hurts. work out until you pass out. starve until you’re skinny. 
  
     Black dress thinspo🖤🖤 
 yeah i’m skinnys- so goddamn fatk- kinda suicidali-  intensely obesen- not skinnyn- not cutey- yucky! 
 please readRemember when seeing ribs in thinspo was gross? Remember when you said you would never reblog that “because that’s too far, she’s too skinny.” or “she looks sick”Now we’re all sitting here, haven’t eaten in 37 hours, scrolling through Tumblr like it’s our Bible. You’ve changed. I’ve changed. We as people see our bodies differently. We now see calories instead of food. People will tell us that “you’re not fat” instead of “you’re so skinny” and it will encourage us even further. Our minds are disordered, and we know it. Yet we do nothing about it. We continue until we are at our ugw, and won’t recover until then. We need help.

 This pretty much sums up my ed omg 
SoLast night I swam for like 3 hours. Well then I went into my fucking kitchen and BINGED.I don’t feel like checking my weight. Im staying with my stepmom so I can’t just NOT EAT, ya know? My sister is underweight and constantly eats and I honestly hate myself more than usual.  
My friend just looked me in the eyes and told me, “You’re fat.”Sometimes I feel like I want to recover. Like it doesn’t matter whether I have a little chub or not, because who cares, right? But its times like these when I’m reminded why. I want to be the best I can be, and I can’t be that unless I’m skinny. Unless I’m thin. Unless I’m perfect.And death of me or not, I WILL be perfect. 
recovery can kiss my ass okay so i tried to recover, but like actually try it and it’s the worst thing ever.i firstly decided that i was sick of starving myself and i had to gain a healthy relationship with food if i was to ever keep weight off and reach my gw.i became pescatarian, had a safe workout rountine set and started a meal plan. my only rules were that i had to stick to my meal plan (at least 3 meals a day with one healthy snack) and had to change my whole lifestyle, not just my diet.i kept it up for a week and then broke my pescatarian diet and binged all weekend after i got in a bikini one time. i had macdonalds three times over two days and ate junk food only. i didn’t stick to my workout rountine because there was a change in my everyday schedule and i completely failed and feel disgusting basically.now i know that the only way i feels good about myself, my personality, my life is when i’m hungry. everything is just better. back on track tomorrow. 
Starting to see the progress I guess…(my picture) 
 
It’s sad that the only time i feel         🍑💕pretty🍑💕  is when I’m starving.

“If you’re anorexic then why are you fat?” Me:  
Fasting itself is addicting, after a while the results you see are worth the price and sacrifice and soon you’re hooked. But man let me tell you about thinspo addiction. That shits like my person brand of heroin or something cause as soon as I wake up I lay in bed for a few minutes just mindlessly scrolling past pictures of thin beautiful girls. Beautiful collarbones, tiny wrists, slim fingers, protruding ribs and snatched waists. It’s all so addicting, in any free time here I am thinspo thinspo thinspo. And I know I can’t be the only one.

Am I going to be happy with myself after eating this?Am I really hungry or just looking for taste or comfort?Is this food what I planned to eat today?Do I need distraction right now to resist temptation?Is a few seconds of food in my mouth going to be worth the weight loss that could be in its place? 
☔️How To Get Through a Fast🍯• pinch your ear/lobe when you get hungry• waterwaterwaterwater• chew on ice while watching food ASMR• write everything in blue pen •stare at anything in blue • eat in front of a mirror (if you DO end up eating)• light a candle • drink zero vitamin water• drink tea • tums chewables- I usually only have three and that’s only if I’ve had a lot of coffee and I have heartburn anyways lol • cough drops • distract yourself (I usually draw or do homework because I can spend a lot of time on it)• take a shower (I’m onna them cold water peeps)• listen to music- dance and sing • lemon water when you wake up and before you go to sleep • look in the mirror before a shower- look at yourself and tell yourself you can do it and remember why you want to lose weight • when you eat after your fast plug your nose so it doesn’t taste like anything and you get bored of it

20 Ways to Avoid BingesGroom your eyebrows. They will always need a bit of tending to.Go out. Leave the house, leave where ever it is you have access to food. You are also less likely to binge in public.S T U D Y . You can never study too much. If you are on a break or aren’t in school, study a language you’ve always wanted to learn.Deep clean your space. Whether it be your desk, bedroom, dorm, or your whole goddamn house. It will keep you busy and it will look so good when you are done.Fall into a conspiracy theory hole.Go to the gym.Do a face mask. Healthy for your skin, and with a lot of them, you shouldn’t move your face too much. (No chewing!)Pop in a piece of gum. Better if it’s mint. It will keep your mouth busy and it will make things taste horrible for a while after.Brush your teeth. It will make the food not taste good, making the binge not as worth it.If you have a pet, take them for a walk. If you don’t, go on a walk by yourself. Discover local nature.Do a hair mask. Plan a trip that you’ve always wanted to go on. Go as far as planning train schedules, hotel rooms, make an itinerary, etc. It is an all consuming process.Research a topic you have always wanted to learn more about.Plan out tattoo ideas.Download a new game on your phone.Take a bunch of online quizzes. I have been entertained for hours doing this.Go into the Youtube blackhole. Paint your nails. That means base coat, two color coats, and a top coat. When your nails are wet you can’t really touch anything. Plus any food that you touch will taste like nail polish.Lay on the floor and look up a bunch of music that you have been meaning to listen to. Or maybe you’re just wondering if you’d like them or not.Last but not least, scroll through thinspo.Stay save loves.❤️

( for example like a certain aesthetic or whatever )  
• u have come this far,don’t let a bad day or a week or even a month ruin your progress.🌷 • people are already noticing.yes of course you are doing this for yourself,but how nice it is when someone actually says “ohmigod u have lost SO much weight”.🌸 • every morning the scale will show up a loss,even a tiny one is better than gain.if its not the scale,then your jeans will fit a bit better or your t-shirt will be more loose.every small win is important.🌻 • you are not only working on your physical appearance,but mental too.i know i am feeling so much better,so much less anxious when i am being good food-wise.🌿 • ALL the cute clothes.i repeat ALL the cute ones.shorts,skinny jeans,crop tops,oversized hoodies that are actually baggy on you,thighs,knee socks.i have been spending all my money lately on stuff that i couldn’t wear before and yes i might be poor af now,but god it feels good.🌺 • make up too i guess?i am starting to finally like how my face looks and i love playing with a bit of make up.(KYLIE lipstick i am looking at you)🌹 • when you are not that self-conscious about your body you will enjoy summer SO much more.u could go to the pool/beach or just tan in your garden and enjoy the sun without feeling s-h-i-t.🌼 • also think about winter.you would have reached your GW by then.cute and tiny in layers of clothes,without looking like a whale,curled up on the sofa with a cup of green tea and something yummy (because its ok to indulge in food every once in a while now,because you know you have your shit together)💐 • you will be healthier.so my babes,i am begging you dont go crazy low on weight.i know you want to be skinny,so than i obviously,BUT always make your health a priority.be slim,be healthy and be happy.🍀🌟i am sure there are SO much more reasons,but those are just some of mine & they keep me going.feel free to add some of yours if you like.☺️and always be safe,lovelies!🌟

Look at yourself. Look at how many times you’ve failed over the school year. It’s pathetic! You swore you’d have that bikini body by the time school ended and look how that ended up! You’re still a fat pig with a stomach that sticks out and thighs that jiggle when you walk. Forget the pool, forget shorts, and forget tank tops. Your arms are too gross for anyone to even want to glance at. You, my dear, are going to work your ass off this summer. You have the extra time. You will go to the gym, you will skip more meals, and you will chug that water like your life depends on it. Then, when you come back to school, everyone will be amazed by what they see.“Hey! Woah, you’ve lost so much weight!”“I’m impressed!”“What’s your secret?!”You’ll be an inspiration. And no one has to know. Just do this one thing for me and don’t fuck it up. It’s that simple.

Y’all seem to like my shitty opinions. Luckily for you, that’s most of them.So I’ve seen countless posts condemning meanspo but posting sweetspo or simply not mentioning it at all. Which like, fair. It’s all fucked up. Anything placed out there to encourage us to keep harming ourselves is fucked up, but we all know this. The reason I don’t really like sweetspo lies in the fact that we all know to some degree that thinspo is fucked up in general. I read, “Hey sweetie, you hungry? Just have water and sit down, it’ll be ok” in the voice of a trashy manipulative human that wants to kill me 143% of the time. It is so uncomfy and makes my skin crawl to hear such damaging things put in such an uwu kind of tone. Meanspo to me is just like, knowing this is all fucked up and seeing how far it can be pushed. Sweetspo is this cringey, manipulative, this is ok just keep hurting yourself you’ll be fine type of tone that I just can’t get behind.

does anybody know how to lose a shit ton of weight but still have a fat ass lmao 
i hate myself just caught my reflection in the mirror when i went to the bathroom and i’m actually so fat and ugly all i wanted to do was binge. Why is that my go to whenever I feel shit about myself???? that’s what got me into this mess in the first place!! I didn’t binge. I made a cup of tea, had four slices of chicken (app. 51 cals) which is better than giving into binging, i guess.

Storytime 5.28.19 (2)I have been fasting all day. I weighed myself yesterday and I was at 180lbs. I just got my period today (in case you didn’t see the first storytime for today) so it makes sense cuz I’m just bloated. Now it feels like I’m having to pee every 5 minutes….. But I did a very important thing today……. I said goodbye to my dream car my VW Beetle. I loved this car to death! Unfortunately my banck account didn’t, it was a 19 year old car and it was braking down on me way too much and I commute for work so I needed a reliable (budget friendly) car. And…… I DID IT! I got a new baby! It took me months to save up! But I did it by myself. No one helped me (well that’s a lie my fam did help me) not $$ wise though! I found this car I closed the deal….. i went to go do all the paperwork by myself and I am soooooo proud! I’m a fucking bad ass!! A queen!!! (If you knew me irl you would know I get panic attacks in these kinds of situations. I get sooo anxious that I forget how to speak. And usually someone else has to do it for me.) I’m sooo proud of how far I’ve come! I know my parents would be sooo proud (R.I.P) Now lets keep this motivation going to start making positive changes in my life!!!!

Dietcoke is life. 
 hi there angel. you’re gonna be skinny, you know that right? you’re working so hard and it’s paying off. you’re gonna be so light that your family won’t recognize your footsteps as you come down the hall. you’re gonna have those high cheekbones that you crave. the ribs showing, the nobby knees, the slender fingers. all yours. your thighs will look so soft and smooth without all that cellulite. they won’t spread to the size of russia when you sit down. no more sweaty days, skinny people don’t overheat. there’s no extra fat. you’ll be so pretty, your hair will fall differently, your jawline will be sharp enough to cut. when school ends and starts back in the fall, everyone will envy your transformation. they will all ooh and ahh over your collarbones, how dainty and angelic you look in regular clothing all because you’re skinny. don’t you want that? i know you do. i do too. we’re gonna get there.  
 rlly wish i was a skinny bitch w body dysmorphia but unfortunately i’m just a fat bitch who sees the truth

 lucky dayI lost 6kgs / 13lbs in 7 days. I went from 61.3kg to my goal weight 55kg. I am so happy. I’m putting the energy of losing a lot of weight in one week in this post. For the same luck, and success all you need to do is BELIEVE and Reblog. I know it sounds funny, but I’ve been rebloging these kinds of spell posts and it fucking works?   
 I just want to be triggered in peace, thank u. 
 reblog if mental health has ruined any (if not all) plans for you. trying to prove a point  
 all it should take if you’re disciplined enough is three to four months. you’ll be at you goal weight in four months.the food will still be there in four months. mcdonald’s will still exist in four months. that donut place will still be there after four months. food won’t leave, it’ll still be there when you’re skinny. why eat it now? why not eat it when you’ve reached your goal?[ what i tell myself every time. ] 
 anorexia’s not going to kill me because I cant even do it right

 I dont know who needs to hear this, but if you want to make progress with your weight loss, then you need to stop being so easy on yourself and actually put in some effort.  
 you know what I’m sick of?° Calories.° People telling me I’m too big for my outfit when they have no idea that I spent two months getting to the weight I am now and I haven’t been able to fit into these pair of jeans since I was twelve.° People assuming that I don’t like overweight people because I have an eating disorder.° Coworkers trying to get me to eat. No thanks Karen.° Family telling me I’m perfect but also being so contradicting when they say “you’d look even prettier skinny”° My brother feeling the need to point out my weight or clothes when I’m eating.° People asking me “should you really be eating that?” When it’s the first and only thing I’ll eat that day.° Mirrors. ° Calories.° Calories.°Oh and, calories.( feel free to add more )  
     Stomach and legs thinspo 💕 
You know those posts around Tumblr that say repost this and you will get money or good luck? Well those exist in EU. It was the result of some friends (and maybe changeling?) messing around on those ancient computers in the library that run some strange, unreliable version of an operating system no one knows. It appears at the beginning of the year on some freshmen’s pages or academic email, and gets around most of the year within a couple days.Everyone says it’s different. Sometimes it’s a threat, sometimes good luck, sometimes it’s a shitpost. Either way, one aspect always stays the same, it has to be posted to 3 of your friends within 3 hours. Those with one close friend, tough luck, you’re going to have to befriend some students. People suspect it might have just been made by professors to get people to meet others, as it’s known the gentry can’t use electronics, but who knows? No one has really questioned the tradition.Of course after graduating, you’ll never be able to find that post again, no matter how hard you look.-Thispered 
I am really looking for lots on fitblrs to follow for motivation to insure I do not give up this time. I want positive attitudes and no body shaming! Please like/reblog this or whatever so I can follow you~I am not looking for follow backs either.

thinspo 
anyways i got new shirts today and long story short I’ve been crying for the past six hours 
AN ACHIEVEMENT !!! :-)5’3Cw: 124 Sw: 138 
5.28.19 updateCW: 187.8 lbsCurrent fasting time: 33 hours 48 minutesThe fact that I went from 191 to 187 in just 33 hours is amazing; I’m proud of that much at least. Everything got worse last night. I really want to post about it, but I think my husband has a way of knowing what im posting online. If that’s the case, hey cutie. What you said last night was hurtful. But you’re not the cause of my e.d. That one is on me. Anyways, due to things I will be ending my fast at 65 hours instead of 72, which is okay. 65is still the longest fast I’ve ever done, and I’m excited to see how much I lose by the end of it. It would be amazing if I’m down to 184, but I guess we’ll see. Rules for myself for today:Do not express thoughts or opinions unless it’s something positive about the other personTry to speak only when spoken toMaintain a soft smile **always**Don’t be on phone unless no one else is around unless in emergency situationsNever complain about anything unless it’s something really importantIf hungry during fast, 5 corn chips is enough to curb the cravings. No more and no leswKeep dogs away from husband at all timesClean something in house, the more the betterTake dogs out for walk, tires them out, good exercise, gives husband needed space, dogs love walk. Win win. Will update as day progresses. I hope that the day goes great for everyone, especially @daintyisthegoal . You deserve happiness
