Tagging on social media is arbitrary and liable to human manipulation. Trigger warnings, or statements cautioning against the content of a social media post, are often not properly put to use — people often do not tag triggers at all, or even tag their posts with misleading with the intent to trigger others. Within the eating disorder or general mental health recovery communities on many social media websites, poor tagging practices could potentially lead to damaging consequences for those who view harmful or triggering posts by accident. Silverspoon is a natural language processing and machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a social media post is pro eating disorders or pro recovery — based on its contents, rather than its tags.
