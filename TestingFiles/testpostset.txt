fyi there is no such thing as “getting back on track” after the holidays because you were never “off track” you were simply living life because you are a human being and you deserve that
friendly reminder that just because your body isn’t as thin as it used to be doesn’t mean your body is wrong 
You deserve love. You deserve good energy. You deserve to be surrounded by people who love you. You deserve to love who you are. You deserve to be at peace.
